      "mq11c_mq11c_d12_08b_04a_000967d9_2.mp3": "And you know what? You were right! I was an idiot, I was a bad brother, but I'll do better. I'll think of funnier games, paint better pictures, and make you love me, but here, not out there.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d12_06_000951b3_1.mp3": "Because I found out that they are only nice to me because I want them to be. And they all just do what I want them to do, all the time. When I play tag with Gajus, for example, it's not really him that I am running from, it's me.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d12_03_000951d2_3.mp3": "It was day, and my room was so beautiful and light, and there were toys everywhere. And...  and daddy wasn't bleeding anymore but was sitting on my bed, and he told me that I just had a bad dream, and that I should go look in the mirror.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d11_11_000951af_4.mp3": "Don't you see? Everybody hated me, they all did, and it was all just because I had these bumps on my face and my left leg was like a clump. Only daddy loved me and took care of me.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d12_05_000951b8_3.mp3": "At first I was so happy, you know? Everything was so beautiful, there were date pies every night, and everyone loved me. Even the other children played with me, because I didn't have the bumps anymore. ",

      "mq11c_mq11c_d7_09b_00090b8e_1.mp3": "Yeah, sure... that must be tiring, huh? But you did great, really! Thank you for playing with me. I'll go back to the village and tell daddy that we're done. Just come back to the house when you're ready to hear my second wish.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d12_03_000951d2_1.mp3": "What do you think? I said \"yes.\" Then everything went black and I felt a tickle in my tummy, like when daddy used to lift me in the air to play Myrad. When I woke up again, everything was different.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d6_branch02sta_00090430_2.mp3": "You... erm... you look as if you can run fast, can't you? Can you catch Thorus for me and get my teddy back? If you don't I'm sure he will bury it somewhere in the sand, and I'll never get it back then!",

      "mq11c_mq11c_d12_07b_0009519d_1.mp3": "No! No, I can't! The stone, it told me once what would happen if I did, everyone would die, because they haven't eaten anything real for years.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d11_01c_00095192_1.mp3": "What, but - I... I thought it would make you happy! But... it was a stupid idea, I see that now. I will paint another one, and this time it will be better, I swear.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d11_06_000951a0_1.mp3": "I just don't understand! It so much better here in Silvergrove than anywhere else; no one is ever hungry or sick, and there are never any clouds or rain!",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d9_05_00092a35_1.mp3": "You have to search with your eyes and your ears at the same time. If you listen closely, you can hear this weird \"ringing\" noise that they make when they fly, and that can help you find them, even in the forest.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d11_08_00095191_1.mp3": "Or is it me? It's me, isn't it? I've been a bad little brother to you, and all my games were stupid and boring. But I will change all that, I promise!",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d9_04_00092a37_1.mp3": "They look so incredibly awesome... Their wings are black and blue at the same time, and they shine in the sunlight, like... erm... like crystals.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d6_08c_0009090d_2.mp3": "I had these... bumps all over my face, and they itched all day long, and whenever I wanted to walk I had to walk funny, because my right leg was always swollen.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d7_07b_00090b7e_1.mp3": "Yeah, sure. All you need to to is grab the bow and then I will make the sphere fly. Then you need to hit it with as many arrows as you can. Got it?",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d9_starttopic_00092a38_1.mp3": "Ah, hey! Man, that was really fun, wasn't it? You'll see, in Silvergrove it's always like that. No one is ever angry around here, and they're all nice to each other.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d6_10_0009090f_1.mp3": "Okay. Yes, I think I know which stone you're talking about, and yes, I can show you where it is. But only under one condition.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d11_16_000951c4_1.mp3": "They came two days after that happened. It was already dark, and daddy and I were asleep, when all of a sudden they came into my room and tried to pull me out of my bed.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d11_04_000951bb_2.mp3": "I'm sure daddy would let you move in if I ask him, and then we could play together every day, and every night we'd have supper with daddy. Like... Like we were siblings. ",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d11_starting_000951aa_1.mp3": "So.... Ta-taaa! That's the surprise I promised you. Do you see it? That's us, on the beach here in Silvergrove, right where we tested the sphere!",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d12_08b_02_000951b7_1.mp3": "You say that now... But how can I know it's the truth? How can I know you won't run away when you see how I really look? Tell me! Tell me how I can trust you.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d6_06b_00090903_1.mp3": "Oh, I... erm... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you angry. What is it that you're looking for? Maybe I can help you, and then you won't be angry with me anymore.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d12_08a_03_0009638c_1.mp3": "Yes, and the stone will make it come true. Only here in Silvergrove, of course, but still. Come on, try it! It's so much fun, I promise!",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d12_05_000951b8_1.mp3": "Yes. I think that the stone can make every person here in Silvergrove see the world that I want, and do what I want them to do, even before I know it myself. ",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d12_08a_02_000951b1_1.mp3": "... Yes, yes, of course. Here, wait, I'll just give you the necklace. Just hold it in your hand and think of something you want to come true. Come on, try it!",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d7_07a_00090b83_1.mp3": "Erm... I don't know, I thought it would be fun? And that's what's important isn't it? That you are happy as long as you're here in Silvergrove.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d7_starting_00090b90_1.mp3": "Ta-daaaaaa! Isn't it awesome?  That's a \"Starling sphere.\" Daddy found it in the old ruin down the beach and put it back together for me.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d6_08f_00090906_1.mp3": "Yeah, I do! They are so beautiful, aren't they? You know, here in Silvergrove we have them in so many more colors than the outside does; Daddy told me that once.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d12_06_000951b3_4.mp3": "But you're different. I felt it the moment Gumak let you through the gate. You see my Silvergrove, but you do what you want, not what I want.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d9_starttopic_00092a38_2.mp3": "If... erm... you know, you could stay here, if you'd like. I'm sure daddy and the others would help you build a house, and then we could play together every day!",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d9_07b_00092a25_1.mp3": "I... I'm sorry, I really thought you would like that. Just... give me some time to take the jars back home, okay? Then I'll tell you what my last wish is.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d6_11a_0009090c_1.mp3": "Man, you are really mean, you know that? You want something from me, so I have the right to ask something from you in return. That's only fair.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d12_08b_01_000951bc_1.mp3": "Why don't you believe me?! There isn't! And even if there was, I wouldn't do it, you know why? Because you'd hate me out there, just like the others.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d7_05_00090b8d_1.mp3": "Yes, it is, but daddy is like a wizard when it comes to fixing things. Everytime I break something, he just glues it back together like nothing happened.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d11_07_00095199_1.mp3": "What is there in that stupid city that you need to get back to? The world out there, it's so... so cruel. So cold.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d7_07c_00090b7d_1.mp3": "Awesome! Don't worry if you do poorly the first time, we can play as often as you like. If you're ready, take the bow over there, then I'll start the sphere.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d12_07a_000951a4_1.mp3": "... I don't know. But whenever I look at you, it's like... like a part of you isn't really there. I know it sounds weird, but that's how it is.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d12_07b_0009519d_3.mp3": "And even if that didn't happen, I never want to go back out there, never! Daddy would die, and I would have the bumps again, and everyone would hate me. ",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d9_06_00092a30_1.mp3": "Yeah, the Moonglow Meadow, that's next to the old watermill. You have a map, don't you? Here, I'll make a cross where the meadow starts. ",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d12_06_000951b3_3.mp3": "He's just... like a doll, you know? A puppet! And everyone who comes into Silvergrove becomes like that, even if I don't want them to. ",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d7_06_00090b88_1.mp3": "Easy: You take the bow over there, and I let the sphere fly free. Than you need to aim for it and hit it before I make it land again.",
      "mq11c__00090b80_1.mp3": "Wow, that was crazy! Come, let's see how fast it can go. On my mark! One, two... and go!",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d10_01_00092a21_1.mp3": "I'll tell you in a moment. Let's go to the old ruin near the waterfall, I have prepared a little surprise for you there. Come, lead the way.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d9_05b_00092a2c_1.mp3": "Yeah, that's awesome! Thank you so much, I could never have found that many without you. I'm sure that was fun, wasn't it? Moonglow Moths are so beautiful.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d7_starting_00090b92_1.mp3": "Wow, that... that was incredible! You're really, really good at this, you know that? I bet the bad guys are really afraid of you.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d11_02_0009518d_1.mp3": "Can I tell you my last wish now? After that, I will give you stone, just like we agreed, I promise.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d12_08c_000951d1_1.mp3": "W... what? No, you'd never do that, you wouldn't! The stone said you're a good person, and I know you are!",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d9_07_00092a29_1.mp3": "Awesome, I knew you'd like it! And I've got something else prepared for you, just let me take the jars back home first. See you soon!",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d11_16_000951c4_2.mp3": "I screamed and I cried, and then daddy came and started screaming too and punched one of the men in the face, and then... then...",
      "mq11c__00090b7f_1.mp3": "Awesome, this is so much fun!  I'll make it go faster now, get ready!  One, two... and three!",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d7_starting_00090b94_1.mp3": "Phew... Sorry, I shouldn't have made it go so fast, then it would have been easier for you. But still, it was fun!",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d6_04_00090904_2.mp3": "Ritha and Gajus will be so jealous when I tell them that I have a friend like you. You are my friend, aren't you?",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d11_14_0009519e_3.mp3": "But that's a lie! I never wanted to hurt anyone, ever; they only said that because they hated me from the start!",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d12_08b_0009518e_1.mp3": "No, there isn't! We'd all die if I made this world go away, you, me, everyone! You have to stay!",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d6_08c_0009090d_3.mp3": "But it just went away when I got older, and now I can run faster than even Gajus... and he's quick, let me tell you.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d13_01_000967df_1.mp3": "No, I - I don't think so. The bumps, they... they hurt so bad, you know?",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d11_01b_0009519a_1.mp3": "Do you think so? I... I thought you'd like it, but I wasn't sure. Thank you, this... it really means a lot to me.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d12_01_00095198_2.mp3": "I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier, but I was afraid that when you found out where it was, you would just take it and leave.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d7_05b_00090b8b_1.mp3": "Well, what do you think? We'll try it out!  I always wanted to do that, but daddy said that I'm too young to use a bow... but you aren't.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d7_06_00090b88_2.mp3": "Ah, and don't start firing before it has opened, otherwise your arrows will bounce right off.  So, are we ready to go?",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d6_08b_00090910_1.mp3": "Erm... I don't know, I think I'm... seven. Yes, that's it, seven years old.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d12_07b_0009519d_4.mp3": "That is why you have to stay, don't you see? Together we can be happy here, and I wouldn't be alone anymore.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d12_01_00095198_1.mp3": "Yes... Do you see the necklace? The stone is in there. Daddy said I already had it when they found me.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d11_09_000951c6_2.mp3": "There is something I need to tell you, but I'm afraid that you'll hate me when I do, just like all the others.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d6_13_00090918_1.mp3": "Well, I can ask for three things that you have to do for me. And don't worry, it will be fun, you'll see.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d11_11_000951af_1.mp3": "I never wanted them to be trapped here, you have to believe me. But it was the only way to make them love me, you know?",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d11_14_0009519e_2.mp3": "That I killed the woman with \"wild magic,\" because I am a pathless demon, a freak.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d12_07b_0009519d_5.mp3": "Please, I beg you... This is my third wish and you promised me that you'd fullfil all of them. You promised me!",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d6_04_00090904_1.mp3": "You found it? Show me. Yes, that's him! Wow, that was... that was just awesome, thank you!",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d9_starttopic_00092a39_1.mp3": "Did you find any? As I said, you have to use your ears, too, that will make it easier for you to find them.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d12_02_0009518f_1.mp3": "It said that it could make everything better. That it, no, that I, could make it so that daddy didn't die, and that all my wishes would come true.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d06_09a_00153b40_1.mp3": "My \"real\" father? I don't know what you mean. I was born here, just like all the others.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d6_8a_00090914_1.mp3": "Erm... Is it? I don't know. Daddy taught me how to read very early, and I just love it.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d6_08f_00090906_2.mp3": "I catch them, put them into the jar for a day or two so that I can draw them, and then I free them again.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d12_04_000951c2_1.mp3": "Yes... and no. It's the normal world, but different... it is as I want it to be.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d9_06_00092a30_2.mp3": "I'll wait for you in the village, just in front of the tavern... just meet me there when you're done.  Have fun and good luck!",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d11_13_0009519f_1.mp3": "No... No, I never was.  All this here... it started when the old woman died.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d9_04_00092a37_2.mp3": "Normally it's very hard to catch them, because they are really, really tiny, but I know a trick.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d7_starting_0009094f_1.mp3": "Hey, that was quick! So, are you ready? It will be a blast, I promise!",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d12_08b_05a_00153b41_1.mp3": "Yes... Yes, maybe you're right. Okay, then give me - ",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d6_08c_0009090d_1.mp3": "Sick... Yes, I think I was, but that was a long time ago. I can hardly remember.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d7_02_00090951_1.mp3": "Okay, actually it's really simple: Do you know how too shoot a bow?",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d6_8a_00090914_2.mp3": "Books are like... like pictures you can enter whenever you want. When I'm older, I want to write them, too.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d12_03_000951d2_4.mp3": "And when I did, I saw that I looked different. Like the other children, just... normal.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d6_06_00090907_1.mp3": "Questions? Sure! You helped me and now I'll help you... That's what friends do, isn't it?",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d11_08_00095191_2.mp3": " I just don't want you to leave, please! Without you I'll be alone again, and I don't want to be alone anymore. Please!",
      "mq11c__00092a31_1.mp3": "Okay, see that door over there? That's the entrance. Here, this key should open the door.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d7_06_00090b88_3.mp3": "At first, I'll make it fly slowly, but in the second and third rounds I will make it go faster.",
      "mq11c_mq11c_d9_starttopic_00092a3a_1.mp3": "Ah, there you are! So, have you already caught enough? Or do you want to keep looking some more?",

      "mq17_mq17_d03_03_00149657_1.mp3": "No... No, it would not, but that is irrelevant. You are fleshless, a projection, and just like me, time cannot touch you... Age cannot kill you. And thus you could succeed where I have failed.",

      "mq06_mq06_d2_03a_0013d05d_1.mp3": "Hmm... The way you say that suggests some painful experiences you've had with the reign of the Light-Born... but it doesn't really matter now with this \"Cleansing\" ahead of us.",
      "mq11a_mq11a_d2_start_000d9b4f_1.mp3": "Yes. For him, the end justified the means... For example, it is said that he once healed a crippled soldier by replacing his lost leg with a new one made of troll bone and dead flesh.",
      "cqc06_cqc06_d00_04_00141751_2.mp3": "We underwent the Sigil's Trial, we've fought our way through ancient ruins, and we found the Forgotten Home of the Star People. I'd say we make for quite an unusual couple, right?",

      "mq11a_mq11a_d11_maya_02_000ea79f_2.mp3": "But now it all makes sense. This must be the true reason for Dal'Galar's work on this \"Angel.\" He must have wanted to use it in order to revive his daughter.",

      "mq06__000d8e64_1.mp3": "Okay, I think you've seen this place before. We call this part of the temple the Chronicum, and in here is the gathered knowledge of the Order, written down in books and parchments.",
      "cqc04_cqc04_d00_09b_0013e9b2_3.mp3": "Maybe I should just leave... Go somewhere where I'm by myself. Maybe that way I could prevent this thing from ever hurting anyone else ever again.",
      "cqc03__0013e924_2.mp3": "There are moments I just feel so... powerless. As if we all know that if we keep going like this, we're headed for a catastrophe.",
      "cqc03_cqc03_d0_03_0013e903_1.mp3": "Tell me, Sa'Ira... How is it possible that our beliefs about what's best for mankind are so different? Why are we so eager to be at each other's throats?",
      "cqc02_cqc02_d01_01e_0013e86e_1.mp3": "Well, what would be the alternative? Transcribe Pyrean books like the Magisters do all day? Or drop out entirely and pour hot water for the Upper City's noblewomen?",
      "cqc01_cqc01_d02_start_0013d089_5.mp3": "By the name of the sun, it's... it's strange to talk about it like this. It's been so long, but the memory feels as if it had happened yesterday.",
      "cqc05_cqc05_d04_03b_00140025_3.mp3": "Phew. I can't imagine that this Coarek will just set sail and go back to Nehrim once we've destroyed his vision of a \"Higher Existence for mankind,\" which essentially means \"War.\"",
      "cqc04_cqc04_d00_03a_0013e9ad_3.mp3": "But you just don't get that, do you? You always come to me, like a bloody dog. Why, Sa'Ira? Why are you the only one who can't see me for what I am?",
      "mq12c_mq12c_d4_03_00134577_3.mp3": "I... There is something I need to ask you. The mercenary.  Sorry for asking, but how do you feel about him?",

      "cqc03_cqc03_d0_06_0013e8fb_4.mp3": "But even that probably wouldn't help. I guess we only care about the things that directly affect us. Who fights against poverty if he's never suffered from it?",
      "mq17_mq17_d06_start_0014bcbc_2.mp3": "They tried to storm the temple, as the Grandmaster said they would. We tried to stop them, but they... there were just too many of them.",
      "mq13c_mq13c_d05_start_00139fa0_2.mp3": "Sa'Ira, I... I almost feel ashamed to bring this up now, but I would like to spend some more time with you before we start this last mission.",
      "mq07b_mq07b_d03_calia_01_0_0015000c_2.mp3": "I... I'm sorry, this is... it's too much for now. We will talk about it once we get back to the temple. Now come on, we should push forward.",
      "cqc03_cqc03_d0_05a_0013e91d_1.mp3": "Yes. I mean... Is it so hard to see that this world could be such a better place if we'd only care a tiny bit more about something other than what's happening in front of our doorsteps?",
      "cqc05_cqc05_d04_03a_01b_00140063_1.mp3": "No. It hurts me to say it, but she lacked the discipline for it. She's an Adjudant to a priestess now, and I don't even know if she's still in Enderal.",
      "cqc01_cqc01_d02_03b_0013d051_1.mp3": "Probably. Truth be told, I try not to think about it too much... and actually it doesn't matter, because I somehow managed to get away before they could do anything.",

      "cqc02_cqc02_d01_02b_0013e857_2.mp3": "Anyway. The one thing I ask of you is to keep silent about what I've told you. It will never come to something like that again, I promise.",
      "mq06_mq06_d2_duplicate004_000d8e53_2.mp3": "But then again, I always had the feeling that the Red Madness was more than an ordinary disease...  Well, I suppose all of this explains a lot.",
      "cqc02_cqc02_d00_05a_0013e873_1.mp3": "If that name seems fitting to you, then yes. But I think we both know these stories about ghosts taking over the living are just stories to scare the common folk.",
      "mq11a__000d9b40_1.mp3": "I remember coming here as a child... The Apothecarii gave me something to eat before setting me on the streets again. All that... it seems so distant now.",

      "mq13c__00139f33_1.mp3": "I think so, yes. They must have been shortcuts for the ones tasked with keeping this place running to quickly get from one point to the other. Just what we need right now.",
      "mq17__0014bc85_1.mp3": "I had assumed as much. Yuslan and he didn't even try to help me after that dragon attacked us. I was lucky to find another way in, otherwise I would never have found you.",
      "cqc05__00140046_1.mp3": "Kurmai told me about this place. This sphere is what keeps us in the air, and it draws its energy from the water... Crystal water, that's what he called it.",
      "mq17_mq17_d05_02_0014bcd3_2.mp3": "Kirash, I... I just don't understand. You are here, standing right before me, and I can see you.",

      "caliadialo_caliadialogue_t_0014f99d_1.mp3": "That's what Tyras said, too... But if it has a meaning, it's obscure. I couldn't find anything in the books, and the Magisters couldn't put their fingers on it either.",
      "mq17_mq17_d06_01b_0014bc66_2.mp3": "But I suppose it doesn't matter anymore, does it? I don't have much longer, I... I can feel it.",
      "mq17_mq17_d06_01a_0014bc83_2.mp3": "But I suppose it doesn't matter anymore, does it? I don't have much longer, I... I can feel it.",

      "cqc06_cqc06_d00_06_00141736_1.mp3": "But then I realized that there's a point where you've done everything you can. And be honest, Sa'Ira, we don't know what the next few days or even hours will bring us.",
      "mq11a_mq11a_d13_03_000ea78c_1.mp3": "By the name of the sun... This Taniysha must have been his paramour. And Maya, the girl from the tower was their daughter.",

      "mq11a__000d9b41_1.mp3": "All this poverty... It's incredible how little we think of it up there. I guess it's easy to forget about the other side of the coin once you haven't seen it for a while.",
      "cqc01_cqc01_d01_01b_0013d05c_2.mp3": "I suppose the answer depends on whether you're in the mood for some gloomy talk. Sooner or later you'll hear it from someone else anyway, so why not from me first?",
      "cqc03_cqc03_d0_06_0013e8fb_3.mp3": "Sometimes I imagine going down there, grabbing one of them by the collar and dragging them down into the Undercity. And there I'd force them to see, just for once.",

      "mq16__001470dc_1.mp3": "The Cleansing... It must have done this to them. What we see here, it must have been their final moments before the High Ones devoured them.",

      "mq06_mq06_d2_04aduplicate0_000d8e4f_1.mp3": "Yes... I believe that. It's a great responsibility you've been given, and as impressive as your skills are, I would not want to change places with you.",
      "caliadialo_caliadialogue_a_0014f992_1.mp3": "Hm... Yes, I suppose. I was never much of a \"gregarious\" person, but, truth be told, I never wanted to be one, either.",
      "cqc05__0014004e_2.mp3": "I think that's the best, maybe the only way, to deal with something like this. Accept it, despicable as it may be, because it is part of who you are.",

      "caliadialo_caliadialogue_k_0014f98f_1.mp3": "Yes, it is. Master Tyras, my foster father... he was Half-Qyranian, as you might have guessed already. Some words just stuck around.",
      "cqc01_cqc01_d02_02_0013d063_2.mp3": "The reason they thought I was somehow involved is that the village priest found me a couple of days before it happened near a shrine in the wilderness.",
      "mq13c__00139f58_1.mp3": "They are escape pods... Kurmai had similar ones on the airship, and I just hope they work as intended. Unless you have a better plan, of course?",
      "mq13b__00137efa_1.mp3": "So you're saying that... What a High One really is is the consciousness of an entire civilization?",
      "mq11a_mq11a_d7_04_000e42bb_1.mp3": "Mmm... That would explain why he hired so many hunters from the village. But what did he need all those cadavers for? The \"Angel?\"  ",
      "cqc05_cqc05_d02_03_00140059_3.mp3": "At first I was grateful, but then I thought about it and realized that there was actually some truth in what I had said.",

      "mq11a_mq11a_d8_start_000e487b_1.mp3": "No, but I suppose Dal'Galar's personal quarters would be a good place to start. I guess the big gate over there should lead us there, let's take a look.",
      "mq06__000d8e64_2.mp3": "Plus, all of the experiments and research on artifacts and magic is done here... so it's a place you will probably see often in the near future.",
      "cqc02_cqc02_d01_01e_0013e86e_5.mp3": "So many people just talk, talk, talk, and never act, because that would mean that they'd actually have to endure something for what they believe in.",

      "mq06_mq06_d2_duplicate003_000d8e57_1.mp3": "Almost, yes. All that is left to do is to take the oath, and then Grandmaster Arantheal will exalt us to the Keepers of the First Sigil.",
      "cqc06_cqc06_d00_06_00141736_3.mp3": "But despite all that, you didn't forget to just let go from time to time. You didn't forget to live. Or to love.",
      "cqc01_cqc01_d03_02c_0013d062_3.mp3": "From then on, they added names to the derogatory stares... Demon-child, witch, whatever they could come up with.",

      "cqc05_cqc05_d03_03a_00140028_1.mp3": "For a while, yes. As I said, I like this place... And I need some time to sort through my thoughts.",
      "cqc02_cqc02_d01_start_0013e862_3.mp3": "This is the reason why I train so hard, why I always try to control my emotions, no matter what people do or say to me.",
      "mq05__0013d057_1.mp3": "So this is the Whispering Forest... fascinating. I've read a lot about it, but never actually seen it.",
      "mq11a__000e4852_1.mp3": "This is some kind of magic seal, similar to one the magisters once showed us in the Scuola. You need to speak the correct words in order to pass...",

      "mq11a_mq11a_d13_03_000ea78b_1.mp3": "Hm... So Dal'Galar had a daughter. And this Taniysha must have been his... companion? His paramour?",
      "cqc01_cqc01_d02_start_0013d088_1.mp3": "What I do know, though, is that the first memory I have is of waking up in the middle of some village.",
      "mq11a_mq11a_d3_01a_01_000d9b4a_1.mp3": "Yes. If there is even just a sliver of a chance that this device, whatever it is, can help me, I have to take it.",
      "mq11a_mq11a_d10_01_000ea770_1.mp3": "I've been told you are no stranger to Thaumaturgy, are you? Maybe you could throw the bag through that breach with a telekinesis spell or something like that.",
      "mq17_mq17_d05_03a_0014bcce_1.mp3": "But that's my rational half. You can imagine what the other voice says. I don't want to lose you.",
      "mq14_mq14_d00_01a_00141cc4_1.mp3": "Better... Thanks for asking. I suppose it looked worse than it actually ended up being.",
      "mq06_mq06_d2_04bduplicate0_000d8e49_1.mp3": "Well, as I said, we both have to take the Holy Oath. You should talk to the Grandmaster as soon as you're ready; he's waiting for you in the Emporium.",
      "caliadialo_caliadialogue_i_00033428_2.mp3": "I would transform, into whatever this creature is. But it will never come to that. You have my word.",
      "mq14_mq14_d01_start_00141cd4_1.mp3": "Sa'Ira... It's good to see you. So, are you ready? The Grandmaster said by tonight Sha'Rim should have deciphered the old maps. ",
      "mq07b_mq07b_deusexmachina__00098560_1.mp3": "Yes, the ruin isn't far from here. Just meet me at the Myrad's tower in the Northern Heartland; I will wait for you there once I've finished my preparations.",
      "mq14_mq14_d01_start_00141cd5_1.mp3": "Sa'Ira... It's good to see you. So, are you ready? The Grandmaster said Sha'Rim was able to decipher the old maps.",
      "mq07b_mq07b_d03_calia_01_0_0015000c_1.mp3": "What is this, an interrogation? As I see it, I just saved your damn life. So why don't you do me a favor and keep the questions to yourself?",
      "cqc01_cqc01_d02_start_0013d089_3.mp3": "Whatever it was, I didn't have much time to think about it. As soon as I got up, I saw three riders coming through the smoke.",
      "cqc01_cqc01_d02_03b_0013d051_2.mp3": "I even made it to Ark, all by myself... which didn't turn out to be much of an improvement in the end, because I was Pathless.",
      "cqc03_cqc03_d0_10_0013e92b_1.mp3": "Sa'Ira, I... I have to ask you something. You've said these... things to me. Why?",
      "cqc02_cqc02_d0_05c_0013e90a_1.mp3": "Yes. It is... immense, Sa'Ira, I can feel it every time it is trying to take me over.",
      "mq13b__00137f62_1.mp3": "But... why? This is murder! If they knew how to defend themselves against the High Ones, why didn't they share that knowledge?",
      "cqc05_cqc05_d04_03a_01a_00140031_2.mp3": "I never thought much about the fact that Sylva was a girl. These feelings... they were enough to deal with by themselves.",
      "cqc03_cqc03_d0_10_0013e92c_1.mp3": "Anyway, I need to make some preparations now. Master Bartarr requested my support with something, I shouldn't keep him waiting any longer. ",
      "cqc03_cqc03_d0_04b_0013e8f8_1.mp3": "Hm... Suffering leads to more suffering. Yes, that makes sense.",
      "mq11a_mq11a_d3_01b_000d9b42_1.mp3": "Yes. I found us a map that should point the way from the Frostcliff Tavern. Go prepare yourself, I will meet you there.",
      "mq11a_mq11a_d10_start_000ea780_1.mp3": "Maybe we could kill the mechanism that runs the barrier with force? But... Hmm, wait. Yes, that could work!",
      "mq11a_mq11a_d16_knowpast_0_000ead3b_1.mp3": "Sa'Ira, if you had been there... I would have slaughtered you just like the others. And that - ",
      "mq11a_mq11a_d16_01a_000ead12_2.mp3": "... That shouldn't have happened, Sa'Ira. That just shouldn't have happened.",
      "cqc02_cqc02_d01_01b_0013e88c_1.mp3": "I don't know. Probably because I was afraid you'd tell someone else about what happened in Old-Dothûlgrad and that that would raise suspicions.",
      "cqc02_cqc02_d00_02_0013e877_1.mp3": "I'll make this quick: There is something about me that you don't know. That no one knows about, actually.",
      "caliadialo_caliadialogue_d_0014f998_1.mp3": "Hm... Until that Coarek appeared, I actually thought things were going relatively well, like with the Sigil Stone and this Beacon.",
      "cqc01_cqc01_d03_01b_0013d084_1.mp3": "That's right, we do, but we are both still Pathless, and that disqualifies us according to the Holy Verses.",
      "mq13c__00139f7a_1.mp3": "True. But if I may say so, Magistra, we should save the philosophical questions for after we have stopped the Cleansing.",
      "mq06__000d8e6b_1.mp3": "Alright... this is the Sanctum. ... It's a place of silence and prayer, and also where we'll be exalted later.",
      "cqc05_cqc05_d02_04_0014003f_1.mp3": "No. I won't let it harm anyone, ever again. No. I won't let it harm anyone, ever again. But I'll accept that it's a part of me.",
      "cqc05_cqc05_d02_04_0014003e_3.mp3": "And I can't and won't do that... not now, when there's so much at stake, nor in the future, if there is one.",
      "cqc02_cqc02_d01_01d_0013e872_2.mp3": "Neither way helps me, and who knows what the Order would do if they found out... especially as strained as the situation is right now.",
      "cqc06_cqc06_d00_04a_00141749_1.mp3": "I guess I always have. I've just never permitted myself to enjoy it before, it seemed so... useless.",
      "mq11a_mq11a_d7_04_000e42ba_1.mp3": "Wait, you mean in a \"vision?\" But... how come? I thought everything you see comes from the Pyrean age?",
      "mq05_mq05_d01_c_02_0013d059_2.mp3": "I've been told what you did in Old Rashêngrad... that you saved the excavations and fought back the mercenaries all on your own.",
      "cqc05_cqc05_d02_03_00140057_1.mp3": "You know, Sa'Ira... I've been thinking. About what happened in the castle, and about the talk we had after that.",
      "cqc04_cqc04_d00_10_0013e9a3_2.mp3": "I... I need some space now, okay? Please just... give me some time.",

      "cqc01_cqc01_d03_01a_0013d03f_1.mp3": "It does, yes... but then, he had lost both his wife and daughter five years before he found me.",
      "mq06_mq06_d2_duplicate007_000d8e65_3.mp3": "But I guess, Master Bartarr's revelation was just too much for him. It's hard to be told that everything you've lived for was a lie.",
      "mq17_mq17_d06_start_0014bcbe_2.mp3": "The Light... It... It burns us, from within. Can't you feel it, Sa'Ira?",
      "cqc04_cqc04_d00_03a_0013e9ad_2.mp3": "I don't need your pampering, your pity, or whatever it is you came here to do, I just want to be left alone.",
      "cqc02_cqc02_d01_01b_0013e88c_2.mp3": "A coward's move, I know, but it was the best solution I could come up with. I'm sorry.",

      "cqc03_cqc03_d0_12c_0013e8f6_3.mp3": "Let's leave it at that for now, we've still got a lot to do. The first of Coarek's ships will reach shore soon, and we have to be prepared.",
      "mq11a_mq11a_d4_start_000dd6e7_1.mp3": "I take it you listened... I don't think we'll get more than superstitious chatter out of these people. What do you say, should we set out?",
      "mq11a_mq11a_d13_01_0014f490_1.mp3": "But to what end? If this device were some kind of \"prototype\" for the Angel, what did he hope to use it for?",
      "cqc05_cqc05_d03_start_0014004b_2.mp3": "But I will always resist. And I will do so without condemning myself every time it happens.",

      "mq13b_mq13b_d02_06_00137f18_1.mp3": "But that's just speculation. What we do know is that neither the Red Madness, the High Ones, nor the Cleansing could harm them. And that their knowledge might be the key to completing the Beacon.",
      "mq13b_mq13b_d0_explanation_00137f82_1.mp3": "Hm... That's the first step of the Cycle. Out of nothing, life forms itself, and from that life, man evolves and starts populating the Earth.",
      "mq13b_mq13b_d02_03_00137f19_1.mp3": "Correct... and they witnessed all of it, their creation, their bloom, and their downfall. The same goes for many, many cultures that were before them.",
      "mq12b_mq12b_d6_01c_001338fc_2.mp3": "To ignite it means to release all the energy stored within, and for all we know it will be streaming towards the container with the crystal in its center, the \"Numinos\".",
      "mq13b_mq13b_d04_start_00137f80_2.mp3": "These shapes that ascend skywards... They are thoughts, our consciousnesses, our souls. And all of them together form a new High One!",
      "mq13a_mq13a_d7_yaela_03_00136fde_1.mp3": "Exactly. A place without war or hunger, where all are born equal and enjoy the same rights, regardless of their standing in society.",
      "mq13b_mq13b_d04_01_00137f79_2.mp3": "Isn't it logical then, that we need something of what we want to banish, like an \"energy signature\" inside it? It might sound far-fetched to you, but it feels right. It is what we need to do.",
      "mq13b__00137f25_1.mp3": "We came across the first of these floating buildings about three hours ago. \"The Valley of a Thousand Clouds\", that's what the Starlings called it.",
      "mq13a_mq13a_d7_yaela_03_00136fde_3.mp3": "Call it a fantasy, but if there is such a place, if it really is like in the old legends, we'd be able to learn so much from the Ancient Fathers ...",
      "mq13a_mq13a_d7_yaela_03_00136fde_4.mp3": "And well, there it is, the answer to your question: I suppose that this naive hope is the reason for my interest in the Star People's culture.",
      "mq13b_mq13b_d0_explanation_00137f86_2.mp3": "Phew... Do you see this temple in the background?  This must be the temple in the City of a Thousand Floods, the heart of the Pyrean Realm.",
      "mq13b__00137f45_1.mp3": "Let's not jump to conclusions, shall we?  Somebody must have built this place, and somehow the maps which led us here have ended up in the hands of Starlings.",
      "mq13b_mq13b_d02_01a_00137f1c_1.mp3": "Good question... They look like energy sources, don't they? The same as the Pyreans used. And that power... it's immense.",
      "mq13a_mq13a_d07_yaela_05_00136fe8_1.mp3": "Anyway, let us continue our conversation at a later time, shall we? I want to enjoy the night sky ... Who knows how many more chances we will have.",
      "mq13b__00137f45_2.mp3": "Ancient Fathers or not, whoever was capable of creating something like this, must also have... known things. Let's just wait and see.",
      "mq13b_mq13b_d05_start_00137f49_1.mp3": "Yes. This means that we have to find the holy city of the Pyreans, where the last Cleansing took place. The City of Floods.",
      "mq13c__00139f08_1.mp3": "Yes, but is this new High One really us, or does it just need us to come forth? Yes, we know now that this is how they reproduce.",
      "mq12b_mq12b_d6_01c_001338fc_1.mp3": "Yes, at least that's what the writing suggests. Imagine the Beacon as a huge arcane... barrel full of blackpowder.",
      "mq13c__00139f08_2.mp3": "But we still know far too little... How did they come into being? How long has this been going on? So many questions.",
      "mq12b__001338ba_1.mp3": "Yes. And before you ask: We don't know yet what the Numinos actually is and neither do we know where to search for it.",
      "mq12b_mq12b_d6_01b_001338a6_1.mp3": "Unfortunately, we don't have a lot of experience in building Pyrean machines. So yes, indeed - we had not noticed it before.",
      "mq13b__00137f2d_1.mp3": "Hmm... This is Starling script. But it's... different. Blazes. Can you take a look at that, Kurmai?",
      "mq13b_mq13b_d04_01_00137f75_2.mp3": "Coarek is right - in a way, humanity does reach a new level of existence. Because it becomes one of those beasts!",
      "mq13b_mq13b_d5_01a_00137f70_2.mp3": "If the Word of the Dead doesn't work on them, it shouldn't work on anything. At least that is one way to see it. Let us hope that I am right.",
      "mq13b_mq13b_d04_01_00137f79_1.mp3": "It's an assumption, but a well-grounded one. What the Beacon does is channel massive amounts of energy and unleash it on its core.",
      "mq13b__00137f4c_1.mp3": "No reason to be ashamed, Keeper. There was a time when I was young, too, believe or not.",
      "mq13b_mq13b_d04_start_00137f7f_1.mp3": "Mankind doesn't vanish at the end of a Cycle. It becomes a High One.",
      "mq13b_mq13b_d04_02b_00137eeb_2.mp3": "We need to use it on a High One, to enter its mind. If there is any place we can find a High One's essence, it is there.",
      "mq13b_mq13b_d0_01a_00137ef9_1.mp3": "He was at first, yes, but he's grown more distant the closer we've gotten. Let's just hope for the best.",
      "mq12b__001338b1_1.mp3": "Well, if you say so. Then I guess we have to get used to the idea that our machine will not \"glow\" anytime soon.",
      "mq13b__00137f5f_1.mp3": "Now if it isn't our missing friends. It's good to see people finding... common ground, even in these times.",
      "mq13b__00137eed_1.mp3": "Yes. It's our memories, our thoughts, our dark knowledge... our collective consciousness.",
      "mq13b_mq13b_d05_start_00137f47_1.mp3": "Where the last Cleansing took place. That is where we need to go, and once we are there, you need to listen to the Echo.",
      "mq13b_mq13b_d02_03_00137f1a_1.mp3": "Well... That's the big question, isn't it? But I fear we have no time to wonder about that, at least not for the moment.",
      "mq13a_mq13a_d7_yaela_03_00136fdd_1.mp3": "You're right. But on the other hand ... Do you have to be a mummy in order to dedicate yourself to archeology?",
      "mq12b_mq12b_d6_01c_001338fc_3.mp3": "However, if this Numinos is empty, then it will... backfire, so to speak. An explosion.",
      "mq13b__00137f66_1.mp3": "I'll try.... Yes, that... hm... \"Tower of Memories\".",
      "mq13b_mq13b_d0_explanation_00137f86_1.mp3": "The sixth step... The Cycle concludes, the Cleansing happens, and mankind vanishes, just like that.",
      "mq13b__00137f35_1.mp3": "This is an archive, THE archive, to be precise. The gathered memories of the Ancient Starlings.",
      "mq13b__00137f05_1.mp3": "If anyone finds anything, call the rest of the group before doing anything else. Now off you go.",
      "mq13b_mq13b_d0_01c_00137f74_1.mp3": "No, not at all... But who knows, maybe it's as the Starling says and we'll be surprised.",
      "mq13b_mq13b_d04_01_00137f77_1.mp3": "Then this is the way. The Numinos... I know what it is, or rather what we need to fill it with.",
      "mq13b__00137ee3_1.mp3": "I couldn't agree more. But at least we now have a trail. Let's see if the lever still works.",
      "mq13b_mq13b_d0_explanation_00137f83_2.mp3": "Do you see the hats? These were the Sunpriests of the Pyrean realm, the equivalent of our Light-Born.",
      "mq13c__00139f57_2.mp3": "What are you talking about, Kurmai? The fact that the Ancient Starlings left this city doesn't have anything to do with us. You have -",
      "mq13b_mq13b_d04_02b_00137eeb_1.mp3": "Well, this is where it gets complicated. But I think I also have the answer to that: The Word of the Dead.",
      "mq13b__00137f2c_1.mp3": "Oh, wonderful. We need to find him. Let's split up, we'll meet up again here.",
      "mq13b__00137ef8_1.mp3": "By the righteous path, that's not good at all. Come on, we have to follow him.",
      "mq13b_mq13b_d0_01b_00137eec_3.mp3": "Just imagine how much history is hidden in each one of these stones... it's incredible.",
      "mq13b__00137eea_1.mp3": "Correct. The \"Echo\" grants you the ability to feel and relive the memories of this world.",
      "mq13b_mq13b_d04_start_00137f80_1.mp3": "That is how they reproduce, how they feed, or whatever you wish to call it! Don't you see?",
      "mq13b_mq13b_d0_01b_00137eec_2.mp3": "By Malphas, it's a pity we don't have the time to explore this place more thoroughly.",
      "mq13b_mq13b_d02_04_00137eef_1.mp3": "Correct. And yet, they never helped any of the civilizations that were extinguished by it.",
      "mq13b__00137f59_1.mp3": "Dal'Varek, I suggest you accompany Kurmai and take a closer look at the area around the docks.",
      "mq13b_mq13b_d04_01_00137f76_1.mp3": "Oh yes, we do. The Word of the Dead. You said the Aged Man left it for you, didn't you?",
      "mq13b_mq13b_d04_start_00137f7e_1.mp3": "Oh, by the Righteous Path, I... now it finally makes sense, all of it.",
      "mq13b_mq13b_d04_02a_00137f09_1.mp3": "You are correct, it is not. But I don't see that we have any alternatives - do you?",
      "mq13b__00137f58_1.mp3": "Sister Sakaresh, you accompany Kurmai and take a closer look at the area around the docks.",
      "mq13a_mq13a_d7_yaela_03_00136fde_2.mp3": "And for some reason this thought has fascinated me as much as the Starlings themselves do.",
      "mq13b__00137ef2_1.mp3": "Hm... I suppose this is where the Council held their meetings, isn't it, Kurmai?  ",
      "mq13a_mq13a_d7_yaela_02_00136fdf_1.mp3": "Well. Did you want something in particular? Or are you just looking for some company?",
      "mq13a_mq13a_d7_yaela_04a_00136fda_1.mp3": "Well, that is a good question ... I guess we'll have to wait until we find one.",

      "mq13b__00137f2b_1.mp3": "Huh... Let's take a look around. He must have gone somewhere.",
      "mq13b__00137f3b_1.mp3": "Kurmai, you, the Prophet, Sister Sakaresh, and I will go inside.",

      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d16_afterv_00029890_1.mp3": "I know. It's just... sometimes it's hard.",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d03_lager__00025250_1.mp3": "You guess right. She said that she was planning to do something. Something extremely stupid.",

      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d05_badeha_00025280_1.mp3": "There you are... great. I think I found Dal'Mercer's manor. You see it? That old building over the river?",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d20_epilog_00029ada_1.mp3": "Well... I'll see. I guess I'll travel back to Kilé, to my clan.",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d20_epilog_00029abd_5.mp3": "Joining this cult, giving her life... it was her choice, and she didn't do it out of malice.",

      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d03_lager__0002526b_1.mp3": "Something bigger... huh. I'm guessing you're talking about this Red Madness, aren't you?",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d18_aftere_00029ace_4.mp3": "I... I just don't get it. I don't get it.",

      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d16_map_3_000298c0_1.mp3": "Good. I'll stock up on provisions in the marketplace and then push on to Duneville. I say we meet there.",

      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d12_statue_00028efc_1.mp3": "Then let's not waste any more time. You go on ahead, okay? I'll meet you there once I've taken care of something.",

      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d15_esmest_00028f51_1.mp3": "Yeah, I bought ourselves a map at that old coot's store in the Noble's District... Gaboff or something.",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d03_lager__00025256_1.mp3": "Really? Then... did you see Tara? A young Aeterna, black hair, blue eyes?",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d14_esme_0_00028f36_1.mp3": "That's settled then: The place Dal'Mercer mentioned must be Castle Bleakstar. Shall we go?",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d03_lager__00025240_2.mp3": "The Morning Dew. It was a trade vessel whose crew is mad enough to sail the Red Sea despite the wars.",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d07_esme_1_00028f56_1.mp3": "Well, that's uhm... good. One more reason to search the house, isn't it?",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d03_lager__0002a485_1.mp3": "Resurrected? So she's an Arcanist? That's not great news.",

      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d03_lager__00025260_1.mp3": "Just one, and according to that mercenary I talked to in the tavern, it's leading nowhere.",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d20_epilog_00029ad3_4.mp3": "And she told me that the worst part of it all was seeing how much her suffering \"dragged me down\" right along with her.",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d20_epilog_00029aa4_1.mp3": "An amulet, yeah. It's an old heirloom and you should have it.",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d18_aftere_00029aa7_2.mp3": "I - These visions. How certain are you that they are... accurate?",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d03_lager__00025262_1.mp3": "Either way, I suppose the big questions will have to wait. First we need to find Tara.",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d15_esmest_0002a486_1.mp3": "You have? Well, that's convenient. Then I suggest you go on ahead.",
      "fs_nq02__00028e60_1.mp3": "Hm... a cellar. But the door's locked. Let me take a shot at this.",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d21_misc_4_0002a488_1.mp3": "Right, the mysterious \"mission.\" Something tells me I'd better not ask.",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d16_afterv_000298d0_1.mp3": "Well, what should I think about it? It's a myth, like any of a thousand others.",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d05_badeha_00025257_1.mp3": "What? No, Tara is shorter and a lot more delicate. I think that's a man.",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d03_lager__00025264_2.mp3": "But there was something else that had happened about two years ago. We had just finished a performance at a festival.",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d20_greeti_00029ab5_1.mp3": "Good question. Shall we go up? The view from up on the roof is great.",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d18_aftere_00029acd_2.mp3": "Fuck the rest, right? Fuck what your stupid \"sadness\" does to the people around you!",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d14_esme_2_00028f04_1.mp3": "Good. And... thank you. For doing this, I mean.",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_combattono_00028f17_1.mp3": "Let's not do that again, shall we?...",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d03_lager__00025240_1.mp3": "Alright. My only clue so far is the name of the ship on which Tara set over from Kilé:",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d10_esme_8_00028f3b_1.mp3": "Listen, you also said that Dal'Mercer spoke of some kind of castle as a meeting point, didn't you?",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d15_esmedo_00028f5f_1.mp3": "That coin from the manor... I dropped it. And it reacted with the barrier. ",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d12_esme_2_00028f46_1.mp3": "No... he didn't. Come, let's find what we came here for.",
      "fs_nq02__000298b6_1.mp3": "Hm... quite dark, isn't it? Hang on a moment. ",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d20_epilog_00029a97_2.mp3": "I'm not sure, but something tells me that this \"mission of yours\" needs someone with a different skillset.",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d03_lager__00025276_1.mp3": "His l... By the name of the sun, I'm so sorry.",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d20_epilog_00029abd_1.mp3": "... Good question. Of course I still struggle understanding why she did it.",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d01_tavern_00025265_2.mp3": "I'll think over your offer in the meantime, and will let you know of my decision afterwards. What do you think?",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d20_epilog_00029ac7_1.mp3": "You know... Tara once tried to explain to me what it's like to live with that Black Fog.",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d10_esme_2_00028f31_2.mp3": "I found her outside, wrapped in a blanket, looking into the sky...",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d14_esme_3_00028ef9_1.mp3": "Let's meet at the Myrad's tower near the Dark Valley, alright? I'll be there in a day or so.",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d04_schiff_0002529d_2.mp3": "But dammit, this is a lead! All we need to do is find this Dal'Mercer person and we'll find Tara.",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d08_more1__00028e48_1.mp3": "As I said, I don't really want to talk about it. Another time, perhaps.",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d16_map_1_000298a7_2.mp3": "Alright then, let's go straight away. Do you have a teleport scroll back to Ark?",

      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d08_esme_3_00028e65_1.mp3": "And you're sure that it was Tara whom you saw? Short, black hair, blue eyes?",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d17_esme_7_0002989b_4.mp3": "Then, the rich man gave all his money to the miners and they left, apparently to the north.",

      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d03_lager__00025290_1.mp3": "Minstrel groups. Bards, acrobats, magicians... you name it.",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d20_epilog_00029acb_1.mp3": "I know. But maybe we can somehow make it easier for them.",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d09_esme_0_00028f59_1.mp3": "What.. what by the Seven was that?",
      "fs_nq02__00029887_1.mp3": "... Another statue of this woman. Who is she? Some kind of goddess?",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d03_lager__0002525b_2.mp3": "Her encounter with that woman... it had never let go of her. Never.",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d17_esme_6_000298b1_2.mp3": "Sadly, the wrong kind of people got wind of it and tried to rob the group afterwards.",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d08_esme_1_00028e51_1.mp3": "I don't? Well, then I just have to take your word for it.",
      "fs_nq02__000298a3_1.mp3": "A well... of course. They needed a source of fresh water.",
      "fs_nq02__00025297_1.mp3": "And just how exactly is that supposed to help me?",
      "fs_nq02__00028f32_2.mp3": "That must be the castle. Now all that's left to do is find an entrance.",
      "fs_nq02__00028e4d_1.mp3": "Uhm... No, I won't. We found the key, so we go in first.",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d03_lager__00025245_1.mp3": "About a moon's turn now. I came with a trade ship from Kilé.",

      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d12_statue_00028f2b_2.mp3": "Hm... No idea what that's supposed to mean. Do you want to take a look?",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d16_afterv_00029895_1.mp3": "Anyway, we still need a hint as to where they went. Come on, let's keep looking.",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d03_lager__0002529b_1.mp3": "... That's complicated. I'd rather not talk about it.",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d03_lager__00025261_1.mp3": "Well, according to the mercenary, the ship ran aground up north.",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d20_epilog_00029abd_4.mp3": "Don't get me wrong... I don't blame myself for her decision.",
      "fs_nq02__00028efa_1.mp3": "Hm... Fair enough. Thank you for your help, Mysir.",
      "fs_nq02__0002525c_1.mp3": "Here. Thank you for your... services.",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d02_treoma_00025287_1.mp3": "What, I won again? This is going better than expected.",

      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d12_statue_00028f3a_2.mp3": "Wait - the museum. Isn't there a museum in Ark?",
      "fs_nq02_fs_nq02_d17_esme_7_0002989b_1.mp3": "Yeah. One of the group's women must have been a mage or something...",
