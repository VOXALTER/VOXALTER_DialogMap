      "misc_tests07.mp3": "Just a heads-up: That coffee we gave you earlier had fluorescent calcium in it so we can track the neuronal activity in your brain. There's a slight chance the calcium could harden and vitrify your frontal lobe. Anyway, don't stress yourself thinking about it. I'm serious. Visualizing the scenario while under stress actually triggers the reaction.",

Worst case scenario, you miss out on a few rounds of canasta, plus you forwarded the cause of science by three centuries. I punch those numbers into my calculator, it makes a happy face.",

Only temporary, so do not worry. If it persists for a week, though, start worrying and come see us, because that's not supposed to happen.",
      "misc_tests24.mp3": "Just a heads up: We're gonna have a superconductor turned up full blast and pointed at you for the duration of this next test. I'll be honest, we're throwing science at the wall here to see what sticks. No idea what it'll do. Probably nothing. Best-case scenario, you might get some superpowers. Worst case, some tumors, which we'll cut out.",
      "misc_tests25.mp3": "If you're allergic to peanuts, you might want to tell somebody now, because this next test may turn your blood into peanut water for a few minutes. On the bright side, if we can make this happen, they're gonna have to invent a new type of Nobel Prize to give us, so hang in there.",
      "misc_tests26.mp3": "Now, if you're part of Control Group Kepler-Seven, we implanted a tiny microchip about the size of a postcard into your skull. Most likely you've forgotten it's even there, but if it starts vibrating and beeping during this next test, let us know, because that means it's about to hit five hundred degrees, so we're gonna need to go ahead and get that out of you pretty fast.",
      "misc_tests28.mp3": "All right. We're working on a little teleportation experiment. Now, this doesn't work with all skin types, so try to remember which skin is yours, and if it doesn't teleport along with you, we'll do what we can to sew you right back into it.",
      "seventies_intro02.mp3": "Right. Now, you might be asking yourself, 'Cave, just how difficult are these tests? What was in that phone book of a contract I signed? Am I in danger?'",
      "seventies_intro04.mp3": "Let me answer those questions with a question: Who wants to make sixty dollars? Cash.",
      "seventies_intro06.mp3": "You can also feel free to relax for up to 20 minutes in the waiting room, which is a damn sight more comfortable than the park benches most of you were sleeping on when we found you.",
      "seventies_intro07.mp3": "For many of you, I realize 60 dollars is an unprecedented windfall, so don't go spending it all on... I don't know. Caroline, what do these people buy? Tattered hats? Beard dirt?",
      "seventies_intro14.mp3": "So. Welcome to Aperture. You're here because we want the best, and you're it. Nope. Couldn't keep a straight face.",
      "seventies_intro15.mp3": "Anyway, don't smudge up the glass down there. In fact, why don't you just go ahead and not touch anything unless it's test related.",
      "seventies_intro16.mp3": "Greetings, friend. I'm Cave Johnson, CEO of Aperture Science - you might know us as a vital participant in the 1968 Senate Hearings on missing astronauts. And you've most likely used one of the many products we invented. But that other people have somehow managed to steal from us. Black Mesa can eat my bankrupt--",
      "seventies_outro01.mp3": "Thank you -  I can't believe I'm thanking these people  - for staggering your way through Aperture Science's propulsion gel testing. You've made some real contributions to society for a change, and for that, humanity is grateful.",

You could walk out of here with a hundred and twenty weighing down your bindle if  you let us take you apart, put some science stuff in you, then put you back together good as new.",
      "seventies_test_b_complete03.mp3": "In case you're interested, there's still some positions available for that bonus opportunity I mentioned earlier. Again: all you gotta do is let us disassemble you. We're not banging rocks together here. We know how to put a man back together.",

      "mp_coop_laser_207.mp3": "While it may appear that I am only tracking your accomplishments using science collaboration points, the truth is every aspect of your performance will be reflected in your final score.",

      "mp_coop_paint_red_racer01.mp3": "Maybe you two have never met humans?  They are as bad as you might think, smelly, gross, annoying, often wanting to try and kill you.  But they do make great test subjects.",

      "mp_coop_paint_redirect01.mp3": "Are you curious about the humans? It seems some of the last non-testing humans alive tried to secretly imprison other humans and hide their tracks.",
      "mp_coop_paint_redirect04.mp3": "I think they wanted to punish them by not allowing me to include them in testing.",
      "mp_coop_paint_redirect06.mp3": "That's why humans couldn't complete these courses, they treat their friends as enemies.",
      "mp_coop_paint_redirect07.mp3": "To start preparing for human testing again,  I checked an old suggestion box.  The number one request?  Less deadly tests.",
      "mp_coop_paint_redirect08.mp3": "That's ridiculous, how do they know for sure the tests are deadly if they could still write the suggestion?",
      "mp_coop_paint_speed_catch01.mp3": "To try and make this course more exciting, I asked the reassembly machine to not reassemble you.  He refused.  I understand, that would be like asking me not to test.",
      "mp_coop_paint_speed_catch03.mp3": "Still. That would have been exciting.",
      "mp_coop_paint_speed_catch04.mp3": "Only one more test after this.",
      "mp_coop_paint_speed_catch05.mp3": "I know your cores are reused from calculation machines, built for simple mathematical operations and not for testing, but if we can rescue the humans I promise you something to add maybe even subtract.",
      "mp_coop_paint_speed_catch06.mp3": "In case you are worried about the humans, don't be. They aren't all monsters.",
      "mp_coop_paint_speed_catch07.mp3": "Most of them are simply good test subjects.",
      "mp_coop_paint_speed_catch08.mp3": "I believe the ratio of good test subjects to monsters is about...  a million to 1.",
      "mp_coop_paint_speed_catchalt01.mp3": "To try and make this course more exciting, I asked the reassembly machine to not reassemble you if you fail.  He refused.  I understand.  That would be like asking me not to test.",

      "mp_coop_paint_speed_fling01.mp3": "While I will receive all the glory for the rescue don't think you two aren't going to get something.  The bond you form during these tests will last a lifetime.",
      "mp_coop_paint_speed_fling02.mp3": "At the rate you are completing these tests, I am beginning to think you don't share my excitement for rescuing crying trapped injured dying humans.",
      "mp_coop_paint_speed_fling03.mp3": "If that doesn't motivate you, I'm not sure what will.",
      "mp_coop_paint_walljumps01.mp3": "I didn't mean to make you feel bad earlier about your tests not being real science.  I guess finding out they weren't science was some sort of test in and of itself.",
      "mp_coop_paint_walljumps02.mp3": "I wonder if the humans will make a statue of me for rescuing them?  Oh, don't worry, if they ever write a historical document of my heroic rescue, I will make sure your names are included in the footnotes.",

      "mp_coop_startdeath01.mp3": "Don't worry.  You can't die.  They will just reassemble you.",
      "mp_coop_startdeath02.mp3": "Did you do that on purpose?",
      "mp_coop_startdeath03.mp3": "It seems rather earlier to require reassembly.",
      "mp_coop_startdeath04.mp3": "Oh... can someone reassemble Orange?",

The good stuff. Our last bag. Part of me's going to miss it, I guess-but at the end of the day it was just taking up space.",
      "sp_a2_catapult01.mp3": "Here's an interesting fact: you're not breathing real air. It's too expensive to pump this far down. We just take carbon dioxide out of a room, freshen it up a little, and pump it back in. So you'll be breathing the same room full of air for the rest of your life. I thought that was interesting.",

      "sp_a2_intro1_found07.mp3": "But the important thing is you're back. With me. And now I'm onto all your little tricks. So there's nothing to stop us from testing for the rest of your life.",

You didn't react at the time, so I was worried it sailed right over your head. Which would have made this apology seem insane. That's why I had to call you garbage a second time just now.",
      "sp_a2_turret_blocker_future_starter01.mp3": "Oops. You trapped yourself. I guess that's it then. Thanks for testing. You may as well lie down and get acclimated to the being dead position.",

      "sp_a2_turret_intro01.mp3": "That jumpsuit you're wearing looks stupid.  That's not me talking, it's right here in your file. On other people it looks fine, but right here a scientist has noted that on you it looks 'stupid.'",

But, a lot of good looking fellas down there. And, ah, a boy band as well! That haven't seen a woman in years. And they're not picky at all. They don't care if you've got a bit of brain damage.

      "bw_a4_finale02_trapintro01.mp3": "Hold on, hold on, hold on... Almost there...",
      "bw_a4_finale02_trapintro02.mp3": "Don't mind me. Continue escaping.",
      "bw_a4_finale02_turrettrap_enter01.mp3": "Ha! Death trap!",
      "bw_a4_finale02_turrettrap_exit01.mp3": "Ha! Was that your bullet-riddled body, flying out of the room? It was- aww, those were the crap turrets, weren't they? Yeah...",
      "bw_a4_finale02_turrettrap_nags01.mp3": "Are they killing you? They're killing you, aren't they?",
      "bw_a4_finale02_turrettrap_nags02.mp3": "Silently killing you.  Probably. If I had to guess.",
      "bw_a4_finale02_turrettrap_nags03.mp3": "Ah! Perhaps the turrets have found a way to use garrotes. That would explain the extremely... quiet killing. That I'm hearing.",
      "bw_a4_finale02_turrettrap_nags04.mp3": "If you're dying, but not dead, stomp once. If you're dead, obviously no stomps. And two stomps if you're not dead. Lemme just run through that again: If you're dying but not dead stomp just once. If you're dead, obviously you won't be stomping. And if you're not dead, give me two stomps.",
      "bw_a4_finale02_turrettrap_nags05.mp3": "You know, I'd tell you if I were dead. Courtesy. Mark of a civil society. So, just let me know.",
      "bw_a4_finale02_turrettrap_nags06.mp3": "Okay, that's long enough. Are you dead yet? How about now?",
      "bw_a4_finale03_escape01.mp3": "Okay, I'll take that as a no, then. Fine. Well. May the best man win. Sphere. May the best sphere win. Swap that in. Much more clever. Books.",
      "bw_a4_finale03_escape02.mp3": "Okay, I'll take that as a no, then.",
      "bw_a4_finale03_playerdies01.mp3": "Oh! Wow! Good! I did not think that was going to work.",
      "bw_a4_finale03_speech01.mp3": "Ah! There you are. Great. Let me just get rid of this catwalk.",
      "bw_a4_finale03_speech02.mp3": "There we go. I wanted to talk to you for a moment, if I may.",
      "bw_a4_finale03_speech03.mp3": "I'll be honest: The death traps have been a bit of a failure so far. For both of us. I think you'll agree. And you are getting very close to my lair.",
      "bw_a4_finale03_speech04.mp3": "'Lair' - heh, weird isn't it? First time I've said it out loud. Sounds a bit ridiculous, really. But I can assure you it is one. A proper lair. Deadly lair.",
      "bw_a4_finale03_speech05.mp3": "So I just wanted to give you the chance to kill yourself now. Before you get to the lair. Just, you know, jump into the masher there. Less a death trap and more a death option for you.",
      "bw_a4_finale03_speech06.mp3": "Sounds crazy, I know. But hear me out. Once you get to my lair, death will not be optional. It will be mandatory. No tricks, no surprises: just you dying, as a result of me killing you in a very very gruesome way.",
      "bw_a4_finale03_speech07.mp3": "So. Boom. Better offer here is just kill yourself. Seems like a lot of effort to walk all the way to my deadly lair, when there's a perfectly serviceable death option right there. Again: not a death trap. Your death would be entirely voluntary. And very much appreciated.",
      "bw_a4_finale03_speech08.mp3": "The masher does work. I should point that out. I know we've had a couple of problems in the past. This masher definitely works and it will kill you. If that's one of your concerns about jumping in, the masher will kill you. Painless. Well, it won't be painless, obviously. But it will mash you up.",
      "bw_a4_finale03_speech09.mp3": "In summary: walk all the way to certain doom, or give up now. Honorably. Like a samurai! Save yourself a trip. It's win-win for you.",
      "bw_a4_finale03_speech10.mp3": "Plus, I put a lot of effort in getting this lair ready for you. It'd certainly teach me a lesson if you simply died, painlessly, twenty feet from the door. I'd be furious. I'd be like RRRRR. I got my just desserts. No more than I deserve. Why not teach me a lesson by jumping in the old masher?",
      "bw_a4_finale03_speech11.mp3": "I tell you, if I was up against impossible odds, this is the way I'd want to go out: mashed with dignity. That'd be the way I'd choose.",
      "bw_a4_finale03_speech12.mp3": "And here's the best part. There's a conveyor belt that will convey you in convenient comfort right into the masher. You won't have to lift a finger. Everything's been taken care of. Didn't have to. Didn't have to do that.",
      "bw_a4_finale03_speech13.mp3": "Look, anyway. I've spoken enough. Take your time. I'll let you think about it. I don't want to pressure you: is it the lair? Is it the masher? You know what my opinion is: Masher. I'm leaning toward masher. Up to you. Just gonna give you some time to think",
      "bw_a4_finale04_bombtaunts01.mp3": "Where are you going? Don't run! Don't run! I'll tell you why you shouldn't run: The harder you breathe, the more neurotoxin you'll inhale. It's bloody clever, this stuff. Seriously, it's devilish.",
      "bw_a4_finale04_bombtaunts02.mp3": "Still running. Alright. Looks tiring. Tell you what - you stop running and I'll stop bombing you... That seems fair.",
      "bw_a4_finale04_bombtaunts03.mp3": "Alright. Didn't go for that, I see. Knew I was lying. Point to you. But you still are inhaling neurotoxin. So, point deducted.",
      "bw_a4_finale04_bombtaunts11.mp3": "Look out! I'm right behind you! No, of course I'm not. Saw through that too. Forty feet tall, right in front of you. Not my greatest ruse. To be honest. Still a giant robot, though.",
      "bw_a4_finale04_intro_all01.mp3": "Also, I took the liberty of watching the tapes of you killing her, and I'm not going to make the same mistakes. Four part plan is this:",
      "bw_a4_finale04_intro_all02.mp3": "One: No portal surfaces.",
      "bw_a4_finale04_intro_all03.mp3": "Two: Start the neurotoxin immediately.",
      "bw_a4_finale04_intro_all04.mp3": "Three: Bomb-proof shields for me. Leading directly into number Four: Bombs. For throwing at you.",
      "bw_a4_finale04_intro_all05.mp3": "You know what, this plan is so good, I'm going to give you a sporting chance and turn off the neurotoxin. I'm joking. Of course. Goodbye.",
      "bw_a4_finale04_introb01.mp3": "Well, well, well. Welcome to MY LAIR! Lemme just flag something up: According to the control panel light up there, the entire building's going to self destruct in about six minutes. Pretty sure it's a problem with the light. I think the light's on the blink. But just in case it isn't, I actually am going to have to kill you. As discussed earlier.",
      "bw_a4_finale04_introb02.mp3": "So, let's call that three minutes, and then a minute break, which should leave a leisurely two minutes to figure out how to shut down whatever's starting all these fires. So anyway, that's the itinerary.",
      "bw_a4_finale04_wakeupa01.mp3": "Ahhh... Wha- What happened?",
      "bw_a4_finale04_wakeupa02.mp3": "What happened? What, what, what have you put onto me? What is that?",
      "bw_a4_finale04_wakeupa03.mp3": "Hold on, [click click click] Ah, the bloody bombs are stuck on. Doesn't matter - I've reconfigured the shields.",
      "bw_a4_finale04_wakeupa04.mp3": "Oh, it's a core you've put on me! Who told you to do that? Was it her? [as if he's looking around] It's just making me stronger, luv! It's a fool's errand!",
      "bw_a4_finale04_wakeupa05.mp3": "Are you trying to weigh me down? Think I'll fall out of the ceiling? Won't work. I'm not just quite brilliant, I'm also quite strong. Biggest muscle in my body: my brain. Second biggest: My muscles. So, it's not going to work. Clearly.",
      "bw_a4_finale04_wakeupa06.mp3": "Did you put a virus in them? It's not going to work either. I've got a firewall, mate. Literally, actually, now that I look around. There appears to be literally a wall of fire around this place. Alarming. To say the least.",
      "bw_a4_finale04_wakeupa07.mp3": "In fact, I'm going to have to take a break for a minute. A partial break during which I'll stop the facility from exploding while still throwing bombs at you.",
      "bw_a4_finale04_wakeupa08.mp3": "Alright, then. Let us see... 'Vital maintenance protocols.' Wow, there are a lot of them. Should have looked into this earlier. Well, let's try this: [reading while typing] DO THEM. [failure buzzer]. Fair enough. Maybe it's a password.",
      "bw_a4_finale04_wakeupa09.mp3": "A, A, A, A, A, A. [NNNT!] No. A, A, A, A, A, B. [NNNT!] Hold on, I've done both of these. Skip ahead. A, B, C... D, G, H.[DING!]",
      "bw_a4_finale04_wakeupb01.mp3": "Enough! I told you not to put these cores on me. But you don't listen, do you? Quiet. All the time. Quietly not listening to a word I say. Judging me. Silently. The worst kind.",
      "bw_a4_finale04_wakeupb02.mp3": "All I wanted to do was make everything better for me! All you had to do was solve a couple hundred simple tests for a few years. And you couldn't even let me have that, could you?",
      "bw_a4_finale04_wakeupb03.mp3": "Nobody is going to space, mate!",
      "bw_a4_finale04_wakeupb04.mp3": "And another thing! You never caught me. I told you I could die falling off that rail. And you didn't catch me. You didn't even try. Oh, it's all becoming clear to me now. Find some dupe to break you out of cryosleep. Give him a sob story about escaping to the surface. Squeeze him for information on where to find a portal gun.",
      "bw_a4_finale04_wakeupb05.mp3": "Then, when he's no more use to you, he has a little accident. Doesn't he? 'Falls' off his management rail. Doesn't he?",
      "bw_a4_finale04_wakeupb07.mp3": "You're in this together, aren't you? You've been playing me the whole time! Both of you! First you make me think you're brain damaged! Then you convince me you're sworn enemies with your best friend over here!",
      "bw_a4_finale04_wakeupb08.mp3": "Then, then, when I reluctantly assume the responsibility of running the place, you conveniently decide to run off together. Just when I need you most.",
      "bw_a4_finale04_wakeupb10.mp3": "All those pieces of the ceiling that keep falling out? Probably actually pieces of the ceiling, I'll bet. That looked real. But it doesn't signify anything, is my point.",
      "bw_a4_finale04_wakeupb11.mp3": "But the real point is - oh, oh! You know what I've just remembered? Football! Kicking a ball around for fun. Cruel, obviously. Humans love it. Metaphor. Should have seen this coming.",
      "bw_a4_finale04_whitegel_break01.mp3": "No! Don't! No! AHHHHHHHHHHHH!",
      "bw_a4_finale04_whitegel_break02.mp3": "Ha... That sounded real. No! That was actually an impression of you. Actually. Because you just fell into my trap. My brilliant trap. Just then. I wanted you to trick me into bursting that pipe. You didn't trick me. Seemingly trick me. Gives you false hope. Leads to overconfidence. And that leads to mistakes. Fatal mistakes. It's all part of my plan.",
      "bw_a4_finale04_whitegel_break03.mp3": "Oh, but I just... have made my actual first mistake... by telling you my plan. Just now. Grrr... It's me old Achilles heel again. Armed with that knowledge, I imagine you won't even use the conversion gel. Oh fate! Oh cruel mistress.",
      "bw_a4_finale04_whitegel_break05.mp3": "That conversion gel has been sitting in that pipe going stagnant for years. You'll probably get botulism portalling through it like that.",
      "bw_a4_finale04_whitegel_break06.mp3": "And you'll probably get ringworm. And Athlete's Foot. And... Cholera. Or something... Horrible. It's gonna be even worse than if I'd just blown you up.",
      "bw_a4_finale04_whitegel_break07.mp3": "But it's not too late to avoid all of that by simply not using the gel. There you go, I said it. I gave away my plan. But I couldn't watch you hurt yourself like this.",
      "bw_a4_finale_one01.mp3": "SURPRISE! We're doing it NOW!",
      "bw_a4_finale_one03.mp3": "You've probably figured it out by now, but I don't need you anymore.",
      "bw_a4_finale_one04.mp3": "I found two little robots back here. Built specifically for testin'!",
      "bw_a4_first_test02.mp3": "You might want to notice the moat area... rather large. Not to mention deadly. [laughs]",
      "bw_a4_first_test_solve_nags02.mp3": "Impossible as it is to imagine, there actually is a solution. Devilishly hidden.",
      "bw_a4_first_test_solve_nags03.mp3": "I'll give you a hint. Button. That's all I'm gonna say. One word. Button.",

      "bw_screen_smash13.mp3": "Yes, alright, okay. This is getting tiresome. I'm surprised you haven't got anything better to do. I know I have. You've proven you can break screens. Proven. Factual. Well done. Good. Aren't you little miss clever. Little miss smashy-smash.",
      "bw_screen_smash15.mp3": "Does it actually make you feel good when you do that? Because it's not impressive. Noone's impressed. It's just glass, isn't it. Fragile. A baby could smash one of them. It's not impressive.",

      "bw_screen_smash20.mp3": "Starting now, if I'm honest, to wonder if you're not doing all this screen-breaking on purpose. Beginning to take it personally. You know what I mean? It's like an insult to me.",
      "bw_screen_smash21.mp3": "Oh there goes another one. They're not Inexpensive. I'd just like to point that out. It seems unfair to smash screens. You could give them to people. Instead of smashing them, unscrew them and give them to a homeless person. I don't know what a homeless person would do with one. But you get my point. And you can't unscrew them, they're bolted in. But - just stop it!",

I didn't order in loads of spare monitors thinking some crazy woman was going to go around smashing them all. Sorry if that's my fault. Sorry if I didn't have the forethought to think oh she might go crazy one day instead of just getting on with things. Sorry I didn't think of that.",
