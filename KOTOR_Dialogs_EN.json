      "nm17ae04an01007_.mp3": "Those mods are paying off. A much better run!",
      "nm17ae04an01008_.mp3": "Just squeaked in under the last time. A very good run.",

      "nglobebant00008_.mp3": "This is no laughing matter! During the crash my lightsaber must have... it must have fallen from my belt and rolled under my seat! The Vulkars probably found it there when they searched the wreckage.",
      "nglobebant00010_.mp3": "I hardly consider myself a legend, Carth. Though I will consider your advice when I relate these events to the Jedi Council. There is no need for them to know *every* detail of what transpired.",
      "nglobebant00012_.mp3": "That was nearly five years ago. I was still an apprentice, my Battle Meditation hadn't even manifested itself. Yet even then I had the wisdom to obey the will of the Council. Unlike Revan.",
      "nglobebant00014_.mp3": "Do not blame Revan's corruption on the Council! Your Republic saw only the threat of the Mandalorians, but the wisdom of the Masters saw beyond the immediate threat.",
      "nglobebant00016_.mp3": "There was something lurking out there, something that devoured Revan and Malak - and many other Jedi. Had the Council sent us all into the unknown, how many more would have fallen?",
      "nglobebant00018_.mp3": "We did not abandon you! But the Council were not about to throw lives away foolishly. In time, we would have aided you against the Mandalorians. But you couldn't wait.",
      "nglobebant00019_.mp3": "Revan and Malak offered a quicker answer, and the Republic chose to walk the easy path rather than the path of wisdom. Now we see the results all around us.",
      "nglobebant00020_.mp3": "You asked me if I think things could have been different? I *know* they could have! If Revan had only listened to the Council, millions of innocent people would still be alive.",
      "nglobebant00055_.mp3": "There were extenuating circumstances. And I can assure you it took far more than a handful of Vulkars to subdue me.",
      "nglobebant00058_.mp3": "Bold talk from a broken-down merceneray who was serving at Davik's heel. I'd call you his pet kath hound, but they have enough loyalty not to turn on their masters.",
      "nglobebant00060_.mp3": "I was not spoiled! I was given the same training as everyone else in the Order! You are nothing but a... no. I must not do this. There is no emotion; there is peace.",
      "nglobebant00062_.mp3": "Enough, Mandalorian. I won't rise to your bait any more. The game is over. Let us continue on with what we were doing.",
      "nglobebant00085_.mp3": "I would never use the Force for such a petty and trivial revenge! The mere thought of it is preposterous!",
      "nglobebant00087_.mp3": "I am not stuck up. I merely have the years of training to give me the wisdom and understanding to see how childish such an act would be.",

      "nglobebant00091_.mp3": "Jolee, may I have a moment? There is something I wish to speak to you about.",
      "nglobebant00093_.mp3": "I know you have... issues... with the Order. But you are a Jedi, Jolee. You command the Force. Without the guidance of the Council how can you avoid falling to the dark side?",
      "nglobebant00099_.mp3": "I see you are quite adamant. No doubt you've had ample time to think on this during your long seclusion. I guess it was foolish of me to think I could sway your position so easily.",
      "nglobebast06772_.mp3": "Actually, your presence at the swoop track is what I'm curious about. It couldn't have been an easy task to find me there. Yet somehow you managed.",
      "nglobebast06773_.mp3": "You also avoided detection by the Sith, discovered I was a Vulkar prisoner, gained sponsorship for the race and became the Taris swoop champion. That's quite a resume.",
      "nglobebast06775_.mp3": "The Force is in all of us, though for most people it is a barely measurable whisper. But there are some individuals outside the Jedi Order that we considered 'Force Sensitive'.",
      "nglobebast06776_.mp3": "It is obvious to me that the Force has been working through you. There is no other explanation for your great success, though I am not certain what to make of this discovery.",

      "nglobebast06779_.mp3": "I'm sorry; I've overstepped my authority. I'm speaking of things that are best left to the Jedi Council. For now let's just accept the fact that you are... gifted.",
      "nglobebast06780_.mp3": "Hopefully between your abilities, my Jedi training and the skills of our companions we can find a way off this planet.",
      "nglobebast06782_.mp3": "Ah, yes, the rescue again. Very well. For what it's worth, I conceed the point to you: you rescued me from Brejik. And yet we're still stuck on here on Taris.",
      "nglobebast06785_.mp3": "Perhaps. But the Force works through all of us to some degree or another. There are some individuals outside the Jedi Order that we considered 'Force Sensitive'.",
      "nglobebast06787_.mp3": "Yes, I can see you do not lack in ability; although modesty is another matter.",
      "nglobebast06789_.mp3": "Your modesty is admirable. But though others helped, you were the catalyst for these events.",
      "nglobebast06791_.mp3": "Please! I'm a Jedi. Such feelings, such attractions, are... well, they're beneath me, quite frankly.",
      "nglobebast06792_.mp3": "I admit, I find you intriguing. Uh... I mean, I find your command of the Force intriguing. But my interest in you is purely academic. Surely you can understand why.",
      "nglobebast06793_.mp3": "Touched a nerve, no. Getting on my nerves, most definitely. I suppose this is what you men consider being witty. *sigh*",
      "nglobebast06794_.mp3": "Now, are you going to answer my questions? Or would you rather just keep annoying me?",
      "nglobebast06797_.mp3": "Don't worry, these are simple questions. Nothing too intrusive. First, what kind of background do you have?",
      "nglobebast06798_.mp3": "But I imagine you've had enough questions for a while. So many things have happened to you since Taris. It's probably a lot for you to absorb.",
      "nglobebast06799_.mp3": "We can speak again later, after you've had time to think about all this.",
      "nglobebast06801_.mp3": "I suppose I'll just have to speak to you again later. Hopefully you'll behave a little less like a little boy and a little more like a... like a man!",
      "nglobebast06802_.mp3": "I suppose I'll just have to speak to you again later. Hopefully you'll be a little more... mature.",
      "nglobebast06803_.mp3": "My thoughts remain hidden, including whatever my feelings are for you. Uh... I mean whatever I feel *about* you... uh... I mean whatever I *think* about you.",
      "nglobebast06805_.mp3": "I... that is, you... Why must you be so impossibly infuriating?! You know very well what I'm really talking about. I'm referring to the bond between us; the one the Jedi Council spoke of.",
      "nglobebast06807_.mp3": "An amusing description, but hardly the truth. We both know the real reason you have some idea of what I am thinking: the bond we share.",
      "nglobebast06808_.mp3": "I only hope I will have the wisdom to help you through the dark times. But for now, we should return to our mission.",
      "nglobebast06810_.mp3": "You are easily the vainest, most arrogant man I have ever met! Besides, I know you can't be serious, since I was purposefully *not* staring in your direction.",
      "nglobebast06813_.mp3": "A lecture won't be much use if you aren't prepared to listen. I suppose it would be best if we didn't speak about this for a while. Let's just return to our mission for now. ",
      "nglobebast06815_.mp3": "You never give up, do you? I admit I'm interested in you. I find you intriguing. Compelling, even. But it's not what you think.",
      "nglobebast06816_.mp3": "You have a great gift. You have an awesome command of the Force, and I tremble when I think of how you might misuse it.",
      "nglobebast06818_.mp3": "What? I... no! No, of course not! Not like that, anyway. In many ways you are... you are dangerous. You could be the savior of the galaxy; or you could bring untold destruction upon us all.",
      "nglobebast06820_.mp3": "Besides, the events on Taris proved that the Force wanted to bring us together for this mission, and there is little left to chance when the Force is involved. Is that not enough for you?",
      "nglobebast06821_.mp3": "I wondered if the Council wanted to see how I would help and guide you on our quest. I wondered if they were testing me to see if I was ready to become a Jedi Master myself.",
      "nglobebast06822_.mp3": "And then I realized how foolish such thoughts were. As the Council explained, sending a Master in our group would only have drawn unwanted attention from the Sith.",
      "nglobebast06823_.mp3": "The fate of the galaxy is at stake, the Council would not risk it merely to test me. They calculated the risks and in the end chose the only option available.",
      "nglobebast06827_.mp3": "But maybe it's time to change that. You deserve to know how much I respect and admire you. I had to tell you how much I care for you. As a friend, of course.",
      "nglobebast06829_.mp3": "Please, it's... it's not allowed. I have to remain true to the Jedi ideal. If this is going to cause a problem maybe... maybe I shouldn't have said anything.",
      "nglobebast06831_.mp3": "But enough soul searching for now. We should probably continue on with our mission.",
      "nglobebast06833_.mp3": "Yes, of course. You're right. I... I have to remember my training. The Masters know well the corrupting influence of the dark side, although it is hard for me to imagine.",
      "nglobebast06834_.mp3": "Part of my purpose on this mission was to guide you in the way of the light; to help you avoid the temptations of the dark side. But I fear I've failed in that task.",
      "nglobebast06835_.mp3": "You're like no man I've known before. And you're nothing like what I expected you to be after... after the Council sent us on this mission together.",
      "nglobebast06837_.mp3": "I... I need time to think about all this. Things are... they are not going as I thought they would.",
      "nglobebast06838_.mp3": "We should... we should continue on with our mission, for now.",
      "nglobebast06839_.mp3": "No, I suppose you don't. At this point I imagine I'm doing you more harm than good.",
      "nglobebast06842_.mp3": "But Malak must be stopped, my own feelings are nothing when compared to that. Yet I know this could affect the sake of our mission if it is not resolved - I can't let that happen!",
      "nglobebast06844_.mp3": "I think... I think we should have some privacy for this. Come with me.",
      "nglobebast06845_.mp3": "What I have been trying to tell you is that I've reached a decision. But this is not the proper place for this discussion. I think... I think we should have some privacy for this.",
      "nglobebast06846_.mp3": "We can talk about this the next time we return to the Ebon Hawk.",
      "nglobebast06849_.mp3": "Why do you think I came to this decision? I know how hard this is for both of us! You just kept pressing forward, so I had to be the one to step up and do the right thing!",
      "nglobebast06852_.mp3": "You're the one who can't face the truth! Malak has to be stopped. How can I do that if I let myself be blinded by my feelings for you?",
      "nglobebast06854_.mp3": "You... you mean it, don't you? But how can I be sure you aren't making a mistake. I... I have to resist. I have to be strong for both of us.",
      "nglobebast06856_.mp3": "But I don't... I mean, I can't... Malak will...",
      "nglobebast06858_.mp3": "Oh, my!",
      "nglobebast06861_.mp3": "Okay, you've made your point. Now shut up and kiss me, you fool!",
      "nglobebast06863_.mp3": "We... we shouldn't have done that. It was wrong. The Jedi aren't allowed to fall in love.",
      "nglobebast06865_.mp3": "It was... it was a moment of weakness. When I kissed you... we shouldn't have... no, I'm sorry.",
      "nglobebast06866_.mp3": "I know we both wanted it, but we shouldn't have given in to our desire. We're Jedi! We can't act like this. Not now, not while we still have to deal with Malak!",
      "nglobebast06867_.mp3": "I'm... I'm sorry. I don't blame you, but... it was a mistake. I have to get out of here before somebody sees us together!",
      "nglobebast06871_.mp3": "I'm... afraid so. Although I suppose I should thank you for all you've done. For the lessons you helped me learn.",
      "nglobebast06873_.mp3": "I wish it could be otherwise, but you have to understand that this is the way it must be. I am a Jedi, after all.",
      "nglobebast06875_.mp3": "I hope you can put this behind you. You need to focus on stopping Malak, as difficult as that may be. Come, we should continue our mission.",
      "nglobebast06878_.mp3": "We've... we've already been over this. It was a moment of weakness, a stumble brought on by unbridled passions. But my emotions are firmly in check once more.",
      "nglobebast06879_.mp3": "We need to stay focused on stopping Darth Malak. And I want the others to stay focused as well. I don't want them to get suspicious and start gossiping about our little encounter!",
      "nglobebast06880_.mp3": "So, until our mission is over we need to act with discretion. We shouldn't speak of this anymore... not until Malak is defeated!",
      "nglobebast06882_.mp3": "I said we were brought together for our mission: to stop Malak. I hardly think the Force would be pushing us towards a romantic involvement when the fate of the galaxy is at stake!",
      "nglobebast06883_.mp3": "Please try to stay focused. I doubt the Council would approve if they knew we were busy discussing our mutual attraction when we should be saving the galaxy from Malak.",
      "nglobebast06885_.mp3": "Mutual attraction? I never said... it's just an expression! Whatever our feelings... uh, I mean... whatever *your* feelings, you have to try to ignore them. Don't let this complicate things.",
      "nglobebast06887_.mp3": "Finding the missing pieces of the Star Maps is our only hope of locating the Star Forge and defeating Malak. The Council explained all this quite clearly.",

      "nglobebast06897_.mp3": "It troubles me to see you behaving this way. Such acts can lead to the dark side.",
      "nglobebast06898_.mp3": "*whisper* The Force is not a thing to be trifled with. Continue to use it frivolously and you may find yourself straying down the dark path.[R1]",
      "nglobebast06899_.mp3": "We should guard and protect those weaker than ourselves... not bully and exploit them!",
      "nglobebast06900_.mp3": "That was beneath you. I hope in the future you will strive to be better than this.",
      "nglobebast06901_.mp3": "That was a truly noble act. The Jedi Council would be pleased.",
      "nglobemala12002_.mp3": "I am Bastila, yes. I take it that you know my mother?",
      "nglobemala12006_.mp3": "Is there something I can do for you, miss? As you can see, we are in quite a hurry.",
      "nglobemala12010_.mp3": "My mother's condition?",
      "nglobemala12014_.mp3": "I have not seen my mother since I joined the order. Do you know what has happened? Did she... say anything about my father?",
      "nglobemala12018_.mp3": "I see. Where did you meet her, do you remember?",
      "nglobemala12022_.mp3": "Thank you for informing me. I really must be going, now.",
      "nglobemala12024_.mp3": "It seems my mother has been looking for me. Strange. Should we get the opportunity, could we look for her on Tatooine?",
      "nglobemala12026_.mp3": "We never did. I am interested in hearing about my father, however.",
      "nglobemala12028_.mp3": "Part of me would rather not see her at all. But if she is really sick... well, we shall see.",
      "nglobemala12031_.mp3": "It is important enough that my mother was attempting to seek me out. Perhaps it has something to do with my father. ",
      "nglobemala12034_.mp3": "I agree. Should we get the chance, however, I would speak to her. Perhaps it has something to do with my father.",
      "nglobemala12038_.mp3": "Yes, of course. I would never jeopardize our mission. However, if we get the opportunity I would like to visit Tatooine.",
      "nm02aacarb01002_.mp3": "You mean you don't have a plan to get off Taris yet? What have you been doing all this time?",
      "nm02aacarb01004_.mp3": "I see. Now that I'm back in charge of this mission, perhaps we can start doing things properly. Hopefully our escape from Taris will go more smoothly than when you \"rescued\" me from Brejik.",
      "nm02aacarb01008_.mp3": "That hardly strikes me as an appropriate way of addressing your commander, Carth. I am a member of the Jedi Order and this is my mission. Don't forget that!",
      "nm02aacarb01010_.mp3": "My Battle Meditation ability has helped the Republic many times in this war, and it will serve us well here I am sure.",
      "nm02aacarb01014_.mp3": "Yes... You're right, of course. I apologize, Carth. This has been a difficult time for me. Of course I'm happy to listen to your advice. What do you suggest we do?",
      "nm02aacarb01018_.mp3": "Well said, Carth. And the sooner we start looking the better; I've already been a prisoner of the Vulkars and I don't plan on being captured by the Sith.",
      "nm02aacarb01021_.mp3": "I think we'll need some help getting off Taris. Maybe if we ask around one of the locals can help us out. We should probably start by asking around in the cantinas.",
      "nm02aacarb01027_.mp3": "I see. It's true I that don't have much military experience; perhaps I should not be so quick to judge. Very well, Carth: what do you suggest we do? ",
      "nm02aacarb01032_.mp3": "My attitude? It strikes me that you're the one in sore need of an attitude adjustment. I happen to be in charge of this mission, if you'll recall.",
      "nm02abgort09044_.mp3": "We should leave. This man may be deranged, but he could also make considerable trouble for us.",
      "nm02abgort09058_.mp3": "That's not exactly humorous. You are encouraging his hatred and blindness.",
      "nm02abithb10018_.mp3": "I will not stand here and let that poor man be stoned! You there, children... leave him alone!",
      "nm02abithb10033_.mp3": "Well I will. You children get away... just because he is different does not give you the right to attack him!",
      "nm02acgurn03033_.mp3": "And then only the wealthiest patrons could acquire the cure. That is hardly fair.",

      "nm02aczelk11020_.mp3": "Don't be absurd. Indulge your darker impulses if you wish, but not at the cost of hurting helpless men. We will not betray this man.",
      "nm02aczelk11028_.mp3": "I am outraged! I understand we might need credits to help us get off the planet, but that was unacceptable. In the future please try to remember that we are on the side of justice!",
      "nm02aczelk11166_.mp3": "That is very kind of you. We are just glad we were able to bring some relief to the suffering of these people.",
      "nm02aczelk11182_.mp3": "That was unworthy of you. Zelka has the serum, certainly, but only because of your extortion. Were the few extra credits truly worth it?",
      "nm02aecand30012_.mp3": "You don't need to ally yourself with this... person. We should move on while we can.",
      "nm02aecand30031_.mp3": "This is too risky. We should find another way.",
      "nm02aecand30035_.mp3": "No, I... don't have another plan. I would rather not place my life in your hands, however.",
      "nm02aecand30058_.mp3": "I don't sense any deception from him, which is surprising. This may be exactly what we need.",
      "nm02afvisi05000_.mp3": "Is... is something wrong? You seem as if something is troubling you.",
      "nm02afvisi05002_.mp3": "A vision? A vision of what?",
      "nm02afvisi05004_.mp3": "This is... strange. Such visions are often a sign of Force sensitivity.",
      "nm02afvisi05006_.mp3": "I... I'm not sure. It may be that you have some connection to the Force. It would not be unheard of. When we first met, your natural talent may have fed off my own Force abilities.",
      "nm02afvisi05007_.mp3": "It is possible that in the excitement of the battle's aftermath the Force allowed you to witness one of my more intense memories.",
      "nm02afvisi05009_.mp3": "The Force is complicated; even I with all my training cannot fully understand it yet. This is a matter best left to the wise Masters of the Jedi Council.",
      "nm02afvisi05010_.mp3": "Once we escape Taris we can seek the guidance of the Council, if you wish. They will understand the significance of your vision... if there is any.",
      "nm02afvisi05011_.mp3": "However, I think it would be best if we all stayed focused on the task at hand right now. We can't afford any distractions; we need to find a way off Taris.",
      "nm02afvisi05016_.mp3": "As you wish. We should move on then. We won't get off Taris just sitting here.",
      "nm03aabast01000_.mp3": "Well, maybe those bloody Vulkars will think twice next time before trying to keep a Jedi prisoner! And as for you, if you think you can collect me as a prize...",
      "nm03aabast01002_.mp3": "Wait... I don't believe this! You're... uh... you're one of the soldiers with the Republic fleet, aren't you? Yes, I'm sure of it. How did you end up racing for these swoop gangs?",
      "nm03aabast01004_.mp3": "Well we don't have time for it now. We have to get out of here before the Sith show up to sort out this mess. Is there somewhere safe we can go? ",
      "nm03aabast01008_.mp3": "Save me? Is that what you were trying to accomplish by riding in that swoop race? Well, as far as rescues go this is a pretty poor example.",
      "nm03aabast01010_.mp3": "In case you hadn't noticed, I managed to free myself from that neural restraint collar without your help. In fact, it's more accurate to say that I saved you!",
      "nm03aabast01012_.mp3": "Brejik and his Vulkars would have left you for dead if I hadn't stepped into that fight. You're lucky I was here to get you out of this mess!",
      "nm03aabast01014_.mp3": "I may have been a prisoner, but a Jedi is never helpless. Maybe you've heard of a little thing called 'the Force'?",
      "nm03aabast01016_.mp3": "But I suppose I shouldn't be too hard on you. You did try to save me after all, even if it didn't quite go as planned. So let's get down to business - we're not out of danger yet.",
      "nm03aabast01019_.mp3": "Yes, I suppose you can. Well, I appreciate your attempt to save me - even if it didn't really go as you planned. But let's get down to business - we're not out of danger yet.",
      "nm03aabast01021_.mp3": "If I'm going to figure out a way for us to get off this planet I need to know what kind of resources we can draw on. First, are we the only two survivors left from the Endar Spire?",

      "nm03aabast01028_.mp3": "Carth Onasi is alive? Finally, some good news! Carth is one of the Republic's best soldiers. He's proved himself a hero a dozen times over! And he sent you here to save me?",
      "nm03aabast01030_.mp3": "Maybe I misjudged you. Carth wouldn't have sent you if he wasn't confident in your... abilities. Forgive me - despite my Jedi training, I still tend to act a bit rashly sometimes. ",
      "nm03aabast01032_.mp3": "Please, take me to Carth right away. Between the three of us I'm sure we can figure out some way to get off this planet before the Sith realize we're here.",
      "nm03aabast01036_.mp3": "You must have banked a turn too sharply, because it sounds like all the blood has rushed from your brain!",
      "nm03aabast01038_.mp3": "I'm Bastila Shan, a member of the Jedi Order and a fleet commander for the Republic. Nobody 'owns' me! Now we don't have time for joking around. What are you doing here? ",
      "nm03aabrej02022_.mp3": "I might have something to say about that, Brejik!",
      "nm03aabrej02026_.mp3": "You underestimate the strength of a Jedi's mind, Brejik - a mistake you won't live to regret!",
      "nm03aacand05014_.mp3": "You don't need to ally yourself with this... person. We should move on while we can.",

      "nm08aahudr11022_.mp3": "We got what we came for. There is no need to indulge your appetite for violence.",
      "nm08aahudr11045_.mp3": "Perhaps you should reconsider. His information may prove invaluable to us.",
      "nm12aabast01000_.mp3": "Dantooine... it seems like a lifetime since I last set foot on her surface, though in truth it has only been a few months. We should be safe from Malak here... for now, at least.",
      "nm12aabast01002_.mp3": "Even the Sith would think twice before attacking Dantooine. There are many Jedi here, including several of the most powerful Masters of the Order. There is great strength within this place.",
      "nm12aabast01004_.mp3": "We can get supplies here and recuperate. The Academy is a place of mental and spiritual healing; something we could all use after what we've been through.",
      "nm12aabast01006_.mp3": "She will find a way to come to terms with her grief. She is stronger than she appears. We just need to give her time.",
      "nm12aabast01007_.mp3": "Now I must go speak with the Council. I need their advice on... recent developments. After I have met with them I will meet you outside the ship.",
      "nm12aabast01009_.mp3": "We can't just keep running; Malak will find us eventually. We need to regroup; we need a plan.",
      "nm12aabast01010_.mp3": "The Force has given us a... a vision. Like the one we shared on Dantooine. Did you see it? Of course... you must have. The Force is strong with us both.",
      "nm12aabast01011_.mp3": "There are some who believe Korriban is the birth place of the Sith... this planet is an evil place. There are secrets here best left uncovered.",
      "nm12aabast01013_.mp3": "During the vision I felt cold and trapped; almost as if I was buried alive. It felt... it felt like we were in some kind of tomb.",
      "nm12aabast01014_.mp3": "No doubt things will become more clear once we discover the Star Map's location.",
      "nm12aabast01016_.mp3": "You are right, of course. We cannot turn away from the path we have started on... no matter where it may lead.",
      "nm12aabast01018_.mp3": "The visions are as much yours as mine - and they are the key to finding the Star Forge and stopping Malak!",
      "nm12aabast01019_.mp3": "Kashyyyk is a lush but simple and undeveloped world. I would not have expected to find the alien technology of a Star Map here.",
      "nm12aabast01021_.mp3": "The Wookiees of Kashyyyk make their home high among the wroshyr branches; only their bravest warriors dare to descend into the forbidding depths of the forest.",
      "nm12aabast01022_.mp3": "If the Star Map is located far beneath us on the planet's surface, as our vision seems to suggest, it is unlikely the Wookiees even know of its existence.",
      "nm12aabast01024_.mp3": "Tatooine is known for little but blowing sand. I find it surprising that there would be a Star Map somewhere in its desolate wastes.",
      "nm12aabast01026_.mp3": "The Star Map would likely have to be within some kind of shelter to protect it against dust and sandstorms.",
      "nm12aabast01027_.mp3": "I suspect there are many such caves and caverns hidden in the sands of the Dune Sea. The creatures of this world probably use them as their lairs.",
      "nm12aabast01029_.mp3": "Perhaps, though that would have been tens of thousands of years in the past. Now there is nothing but the howling emptiness of the Dune Sea.",
      "nm12aabast01030_.mp3": "It is strange that anyone would have built a Star Map here; the entire surface of Manaan is covered by nothing but vast oceans.",
      "nm12aabast01032_.mp3": "The ocean floor is vast and much of it is uncharted, even by the native Selkath. But how could Revan and Malak have found their way down?",
      "nm12aabast01034_.mp3": "It is possible. The melting of polar caps or a cataclysmic earthquake could have buried the land beneath the waves eons ago. Records from that time are incomplete.",
      "nm12aabast01035_.mp3": "Another vision. The Force is guiding us, helping us retrace the steps of Malak and his old Master. Leading us ever closer to the Star Forge.",
      "nm12aabast01036_.mp3": "You felt it, yes? Another vision? The Force continues to work through us; showing us the Star Maps unearthed by Revan and Malak.",
      "nm12aabast01059_.mp3": "Hmmm... maybe you're right. Most of the dark Jedi would only know me by name, but there are a few among them who might recognize my face.",
      "nm12aabast01060_.mp3": "For the safety of our mission I must remain on the Ebon Hawk while we are on this planet.",
      "nm12aabast06895_.mp3": "We can't risk having any of the dark Jedi Masters recognize me. For the sake of the mission I must remain hidden in the Ebon Hawk while we are on this world.",
      "nm12aac02001000_.mp3": "What happened? What's going on?",
      "nm12aac02001002_.mp3": "Do you recognize the ship? ",
      "nm12aac06001000_.mp3": "The Republic Fleet must have got the message Carth sent as we were crashing onto that planet. Maybe we can use their arrival to our advantage. ",
      "nm12aac06001001_.mp3": " If Malak is distracted by the attack, we should be able to get in close enough to dock on the Star Forge and hunt the Dark Lord down!",
      "nm12aac06001003_.mp3": "Admiral Dodonna, this is Bastila Shan of the Jedi Order.  We are receiving your transmission.",
      "nm12aac06001005_.mp3": "The Jedi sent to rescue me from the Dark Lord did their job well - though I am sorry to report Carth did not survive the mission.",
      "nm12aac06001009_.mp3": "Don't pull back, Admiral.  You have to attack the Star Forge now, otherwise the Sith will use its power to destroy the Republic.",
      "nm12aac06001018_.mp3": "As you wish, Master Vandar.",
      "nm12aac06001020_.mp3": "The fools!  Even Master Vandar did not realize you have reclaimed your identity as the Dark Lord! ## The Jedi strike team and the Republic forces will provide the perfect distraction as we hunt down your ex-apprentice.  And once we have slain Malak, I can use my Battle Meditation ## and the power of the Star Forge to crush the Republic fleet.",
      "nm12aac06001021_.mp3": "All our enemies will be destroyed in a single glorious day!",
      "nm12aacuts01000_.mp3": "Plot a course for Dantooine! There's a Jedi enclave there where we can find refuge!",
      "nm12aacuts01002_.mp3": "Quickly, to the gun turrets! You have to hold the Sith fighters off until we get those hyperspace coordinates punched in.\n",
      "nm13aaahla03014_.mp3": "This task has its own importance. It may also serve to divert our minds for a short time... something which carries its own rewards.",
      "nm13aabast01000_.mp3": "Dantooine looks peaceful enough, but packs of kath hounds roam these plains. We would be wise to keep our guard up while we are out here.",
      "nm13aabast01002_.mp3": "Look at all these crystals - so beautiful, and so powerful. Each crystal gives off a different energy stream, so choose wisely when selecting the one for your lightsaber.",
      "nm13aabast01004_.mp3": "Ahlan Matale has a reputation for being very temperamental. You must be the model of diplomacy when you speak to him.",
      "nm13aabast01009_.mp3": "This is the entrance we saw in our dream. The Force has shown us how to open these doors through our visions. ",
      "nm13aabast01011_.mp3": "Nothing seems to be happening. If we focus our minds together, we may be able to call on the Force and witness the vision of Malak and Revan once more.",
      "nm13aabast01013_.mp3": "Open yourself to the power. Let the Force flow through you.",
      "nm13aabast01016_.mp3": "As you wish - though a Jedi must not be afraid to turn to the Force when in need of guidance. ",
      "nm13aabast01018_.mp3": "We have done as the vision directed. When we pass through this door we will learn the secret uncovered by Malak and Revan.",
      "nm13aabast01020_.mp3": "I have spoken briefly with the Council; they request an audience with you. We should go at once.",
      "nm13aabast01024_.mp3": "I'm sorry, Carth, but I cannot tell you. All I ask is that you trust in the Force and the wisdom of the Council.",
      "nm13aabast01028_.mp3": "Come, they are expecting us. I will lead you to the Council chambers.",
      "nm13aabast01030_.mp3": "The vision again! Did you see it? You must have. Revan and Malak were here before us - I feel their dark presence. They must have come and found... this.",
      "nm13aabast01032_.mp3": "It's a map of hyperspace coordinates. Some sort of star chart. But what is this Sith Star Forge they mentioned? And why did they lust to uncover its secrets?",
      "nm13aabast01034_.mp3": "Maybe... that might explain how the Sith were able to amass a fleet so quickly...",
      "nm13aabast01036_.mp3": "Whatever this Star Forge is, it was important enough for Revan and Malak to betray the Jedi. This Star Forge must be the seat of their power. If it could be destroyed...",
      "nm13aabast01038_.mp3": "The hyperspace coordinates on this map might lead us to the Star Forge, if they were complete. But there are pieces missing.",
      "nm13aabast01041_.mp3": "I recognize one of the planets on the map: Korriban - a Sith world. And if that's Korriban, then this must be Kashyyyk... and Tatooine... and here's Manaan...",
      "nm13aabast01043_.mp3": "Now I think I understand. This map was only the starting point for Revan's dark journey into the ways of the Sith. ",
      "nm13aabast01045_.mp3": "Tatooine, Kashyyyk, Manaan, Korriban: Revan visited each of these worlds searching for clues to reveal the hidden location of the Star Forge.",
      "nm13aabast01047_.mp3": "Before we do anything we must inform the council of what we have discovered. They will decide our next course of action, though I suspect our task has only just begun.",
      "nm13aabast01052_.mp3": "Such thoughts speak of the dark side! We serve the Republic and the Jedi Council. It must be their decision as to what course of action to take.",
      "nm13aabast01057_.mp3": "The Council has finished its deliberations and are waiting. We should see them now.",
      "nm13aabast01059_.mp3": "The Council must be told about what we have discovered! Meet me in the Council chambers.",
      "nm13aabast04000_.mp3": "If you have questions, you should direct them towards the Jedi Council members.",
      "nm13aacrat07091_.mp3": "The crystals are sacred! No self-respecting Jedi would ever do such a thing!",
      "nm13aaelis08026_.mp3": "I think we understand. Love can do strange things to anyone.",
      "nm13aaelis08039_.mp3": "Well, if his ego is similarly halved he should be just about right.",
      "nm13aajuha11029_.mp3": "This has been a painful lesson, Juhani, but it seems you have learned it well. I am certain you will be a credit to the Order.",
      "nm13aashen16006_.mp3": "Good luck to you both. May you find the happiness you deserve.",
      "nm13aavand17306_.mp3": "What are you talking about? The Council must be told of what we found there!",
      "nm13aavand17307_.mp3": "We found an incomplete Star Map, Master Vandar. And an ancient droid that mentioned something about a Star Forge.",
      "nm13aavand17308_.mp3": "*whisper* It is obvious Master Vandar senses something is not right with your story. Yet he chooses to believe you, and I will not question the wisdom of a Jedi Master.",
      "nm13aazhar19011_.mp3": "Proof? Surely the entire Council can feel the strength of the Force within this man... and I have already related to you the events that took place on Taris...",
      "nm13aazhar19023_.mp3": "As you wish, Master Vandar. We shall return to the Ebon Hawk and leave you to your deliberations. ",
      "nm13aazhar19026_.mp3": "Proof? Surely the entire Council can feel the strength of the Force within this woman... and I have already related to you the events that took place on Taris...",
      "nm13aazhar19028_.mp3": "This is no trap. The Council just wants to talk to you. There is much that needs to be discussed.",
      "nm14aaelis04039_.mp3": "There is no need for you to make fun of her. She is obviously desperate.",
      "nm14aaelis04041_.mp3": "Carth! Enough!",
      "nm14aajon006025_.mp3": "Carth, I'm standing right here.",
      "nm14aajon006030_.mp3": "Perhaps we should look into this matter. I was unaware of any Mandalorian activity here, myself.",
      "nm14aanemo07011_.mp3": "Greetings, Master Nemo. It is good to see you again.",
      "nm14abahla01032_.mp3": "I'm impressed, Carth. That interjection was very Jedi-like.",
      "nm14abahla01038_.mp3": "Two thousand? Even if he would pay such a fee, what could you possibly need so many credits for?",
      "nm14abahla01047_.mp3": "I'm afraid Ahlan is not just making idle threats. He is rash and foolish enough to attempt a full assault on the Sandral estate. Such action would result in all-out war between the families.",
      "nm14abmdro03022_.mp3": "I am sure the Council will realize these accusations are completely unfounded. The Matale grievance will fall on deaf ears. ",
      "nm14acbolo01022_.mp3": "Don't be absurd. Can't you be serious?",
      "nm14acbolo01345_.mp3": "Well done. I am impressed... I'm not sure I could have done as well.",
      "nm14acbolo01361_.mp3": "We should provide what help we can. Surely it is not that difficult to ascertain the truth.",
      "nm14adc86901076_.mp3": "Do not do this...",
      "nm14adcuts02361_.mp3": "Are you mad? They will slaughter each other!",
      "nm15aaanci01004_.mp3": "I think the droid is trying to communicate with us by cycling through a variety of languages. Each time it spoke it was using a very different alien dialect.",
      "nm15aaanci01005_.mp3": "The droid can probably understand us. The only problem is it may not have been programmed with the phonemes of a language we can understand.",
      "nm15aaanci01008_.mp3": "I recognize this language as well. It is an archaic variant of the Selkath dialect spoken on Manaan. But why would a droid on Dantooine be programmed to speak ancient Selkath?",
      "nm15aaanci01011_.mp3": "It must be referring to Revan. The Dark Lord and Malak likely encountered this droid when they explored these ruins.",
      "nm15aaanci01017_.mp3": "Ten revolutions would take more than 20,000 years. If this is true then this droid is nearly 5,000 years older than the Republic itself! There must be some mistake.",
      "nm15aaanci01023_.mp3": "The droid must be talking about poor Nemo. The Council sent him here to investigate... and it cost him his life.",
      "nm15aaanci01029_.mp3": "Revan and Malak unlocked the sealed door and uncovered the secrets of the Star Forge. Now Malak is using the Star Forge to fuel his conquest of the Republic. ",
      "nm15aaanci01030_.mp3": "We have to find out what they uncovered. We have to find a way to unseal these doors to learn more about the Star Forge! The Republic is depending on us.",
      "nm15aaanci01036_.mp3": "These Builders must have been an extinct people, though it is strange there is no record of their existence. Even the archives at the Jedi Academy make no mention of them.",
      "nm15aaanci01037_.mp3": "In the years before the Republic the Hutts were a dominant force in the galaxy, but they never constructed an empire. In fact, I know of no species that would fit with this information.",
      "nm15aaanci01050_.mp3": "The droid is obviously not programmed with the knowledge we seek. The Star Forge sounds like some type of weapon, perhaps... though, in fact, it could be anything",
      "nm15aaanci01052_.mp3": "Maybe... that might explain how the Sith were able to amass a fleet so quickly. But I suspect the Star Forge is more powerful than a mere factory.",
      "nm15aaanci01053_.mp3": "Maybe the droid has more information we can use. It seems to respond to you; perhaps you should ask it something else.",
      "nm15aaanci01055_.mp3": "Our vision was clear. We saw Revan and Malak speaking of the Star Forge. I am certain it is somehow connected to the Sith's sudden rise to power.",
      "nm15aabast02000_.mp3": "If the droid is correct, then we must complete the tasks in the proving grounds to the east and west before these doors will open.",
      "nm15aabast02001_.mp3": "This... this must be what Revan and Malak found when they entered this temple. This must be where their journey down the dark side began.",
      "nm15aabast02003_.mp3": "This is a... a map. Some sort of intergalactic navigational chart. Revan and Malak must have used this to lead them to the Star Forge.",
      "nm15aabast02004_.mp3": "We could use this map to follow their path and find the Star Forge ourselves. But we must be wary... they may have laid traps or concealed what they found.",
      "nm15aabast02007_.mp3": "I... I don't know, but Revan and Malak were very interested in finding it. It must be a tool of some type... or maybe a weapon. Perhaps the Council can tell us more.",
      "nm15aabast02008_.mp3": "But I think this map might be the key to finding the Star Forge, whatever it is.",
      "nm15aabast02009_.mp3": "See this world here? This looks like Korriban, a Sith world. And if that's Korriban, then this is... Kashyyyk... and Tatooine... and here's Manaan.",
      "nm15aabast02010_.mp3": "But there are pieces missing: incomplete hyperspace coordinates, corrupted data... and there doesn't seem to be anything indicating where the Star Forge itself might be.",
      "nm15aabast02012_.mp3": "I was thinking that, too. This map can't take us to the Star Forge, but I know that Revan and Malak visited Korriban at least once. Perhaps they discovered something more there.",
      "nm15aabast02013_.mp3": "They may have found something on each of the other worlds that completed this map. Maybe if we find all the pieces they will lead us to the Star Forge... and some way to destroy it.",
      "nm15aabast02015_.mp3": "What if I'm right? We can't ignore this. Finding the Star Forge might very well be the key to defeating the Sith!",
      "nm15aabast02016_.mp3": "We must inform the Council of what we have discovered. They must decide our next course of action, though I suspect our task has only just begun.",
      "nm16aanuri01012_.mp3": "Jedi are renowned for their fairness and pursuit of justice. There is nothing to fear from us... unless you have something to hide.",
      "nm16aanuri01016_.mp3": "Privacy is all well and good, but justice must be valued higher. Is it not obvious to you that this man hides something?",
      "nm16aanuri01031_.mp3": "Typical. Anything to continue the feud which has become so customary to you people.",
      "nm16aanuri01044_.mp3": "Your actions show you are overly focused on material wealth. This is not the way of the Jedi. You will have to learn to let go of your greed if you wish to walk in the light.",
      "nm16aaraha02009_.mp3": "I see. Well there is the answer we seek. The Jedi Council should be informed of this at once.",
      "nm16aaraha02011_.mp3": "Of course not. It seems very simple to me. The Council must be allowed to decide the next step.",
      "nm16aaraha02035_.mp3": "The Council would not approve of your actions here. Perhaps we should find this girl and try to help her.",
      "nm17aa03sh01031_.mp3": "Thank you for helping this woman. It may not seem like such a great thing to you, but you are making a difference.",
      "nm17aa03sh01052_.mp3": "Was that really necessary? I hope you intend to keep your word if you act so forcefully with an innocent.",
      "nm17aa03sh01061_.mp3": "This is beneath even you, stealing from a helpless woman. How could you?!",
      "nm17aa11iz05096_.mp3": "So these Jawas are scavengers who are enslaved by the Sand People? I think I am beginning to understand his plight.",
      "nm17aa11iz05106_.mp3": "It could be that this Jawa knows things about this planet's history that the Republic has no inkling of.",
      "nm17aa11iz05114_.mp3": "It does seem convenient, but we've no reason to disbelieve this creature.",
      "nm17aa11iz05118_.mp3": "I am *not* naive, Carth. I simply sense no deceit here.",
      "nm17aaiziz99154_.mp3": "This nothing but wanton greed and cruelty! Beware, lest these things lead you to the dark side.",
      "nm17aaxbas12000_.mp3": "Have you seen a woman that may resemble me somewhat? She is my mother.",
      "nm17aaxbas12001_.mp3": "Ask whether they have seen my mother.",
      "nm17aaxbas12002_.mp3": "My mother was supposed to be here somewhere. Ask if they have seen her.",
      "nm17aaxbas12003_.mp3": "That messenger said my mother is on Tatooine somewhere. We should ask about her.",
      "nm17aaxbas12004_.mp3": "We should try to find her. I doubt she wants to be kept waiting.",
      "nm17aaxbas12005_.mp3": "I want to find out what my mother wanted. We need to find her.",
      "nm17ac08yu02016_.mp3": "And if the unit proves even more 'uncooperative' once we purchase it?",
      "nm17ad03gu03141_.mp3": "These... things... are just looking for trouble. Be careful.",
      "nm17ad03ta06074_.mp3": "He seems pretty forward, period.",
      "nm17ad03ta06076_.mp3": "Perhaps you had best turn your thoughts back to your wife, sir.",
      "nm17ae04ce02008_.mp3": "My friend tells the truth. I am a Jedi... are you going to imply that I am lying, as well?",
      "nm17ae04ce02025_.mp3": "And? It sounds like you have something special. What do you want help with?",
      "nm17ae04ce02088_.mp3": "[Force Persuade] I have heard enough. You want to act in a fair manner. Now.",
      "nm17ae04ga03064_.mp3": "I would have thought we have more important things to do than extort credits from the common folk.",
      "nm17ae04ni04025_.mp3": "Forcing the boy to sign his life away? Is that really necessary?",
      "nm17af07ja05008_.mp3": "It's not that hard to understand if you listen. It's just... odd.",
      "nm17af07ja05012_.mp3": "Your sarcasm is not appreciated, Carth.",
      "nm17af07ja05025_.mp3": "No doubt with good reason.",
      "nm17afhhel01008_.mp3": "I have the holocron, Mother. I'm just not sure I want to give it to you.",
      "nm17afhhel01012_.mp3": "I've never denied you anything, Mother. You may think I don't remember what it was like before I left for the order, but I do.",
      "nm17afhhel01014_.mp3": "You were the one who pushed Father to go on one treasure hunt after the other. You loved living in wealth. You think I don't remember the fights?",
      "nm17afhhel01016_.mp3": "You were eager to send me to the Jedi, even though I didn't want to go. You took Father away from me, and now this holocron is all I have of him.",
      "nm17afhhel01020_.mp3": "No. I don't wish to argue with you any more, Mother. It's time we parted ways, now, for both our benefit.",
      "nm17afhhel01022_.mp3": "You don't know her. My mother is notoriously deceptive when she wants something. Why should she have the holocron?",
      "nm17afhhel01026_.mp3": "I find it difficult to believe anything you say, Mother.",
      "nm17afhhel01028_.mp3": "*Sigh* You're right. It shames me, but I just... I find it difficult to... let go of the past. I'm... sorry, Mother.",
      "nm17afhhel01036_.mp3": "So that's why you gave me to the Order?",
      "nm17afhhel01048_.mp3": "I'm so sorry, Mother. I don't know what to say...",
      "nm17afhhel01050_.mp3": "Keep the holocron, Bastila. It would do me good to know you have it. This... talking to you... this is what I really needed before I...",
      "nm17afhhel01052_.mp3": "I know, Mother. Thank you. I'm glad we talked, too.",
      "nm17afhhel01058_.mp3": "Where are you going to go?",
      "nm17afhhel01062_.mp3": "I'll try. Farewell, Mother.",
      "nm17afhhel01076_.mp3": "I... perhaps not. I can remember my father well enough. But I ask you: why should she have it?",
      "nm17afhhel01081_.mp3": "On the contrary, I've learned much. I've learned, for instance, when it is best to walk away from a situation that can lead only to conflict.",
      "nm17afhhel01087_.mp3": "Farewell, Mother. May the Force be with you.",
      "nm17afhhel01091_.mp3": "I don't have the holocron, if that's what you're asking.",
      "nm17afhhel01119_.mp3": "I am here, Mother. Or don't you recognize me?",
      "nm17afhhel01123_.mp3": "You knew as well as I communication would be impossible once I joined the order. Now what is this about? Where is Father?",
      "nm17afhhel01127_.mp3": "Has something happened to him? Are you going to tell me or not?",
      "nm17afhhel01131_.mp3": "Dead? What happened? What did you do to him?!",
      "nm17afhhel01137_.mp3": "I was told you were sick. Are you actually dying, or is this merely melodrama for my benefit?",
      "nm17afhhel01141_.mp3": "You could start by telling me what you got Father into that killed him.",
      "nm17afhhel01149_.mp3": "How can you be sure of that? Father is an experienced --",
      "nm17afhhel01153_.mp3": "I... see. So what do you want from me? Credits?",
      "nm17afhhel01157_.mp3": "Why? So you can sell it?",
      "nm17afhhel01161_.mp3": "We're very busy on a mission from the Jedi Council. I doubt I'll have the time. Ask my companions if you doubt me.",
      "nm17afhhel01165_.mp3": "What remains would there be? Krayt dragons are huge predators, easily able to devour a human, and the desert is a harsh environment.",
      "nm17afhhel01167_.mp3": "Finding my father's remains would be an even more impossible task than finding his holocron. An ignoble end to a fine man.",
      "nm17afhhel01169_.mp3": "It doesn't seem to have anything to do with what she's asking. Are you actually sick, Mother?",
      "nm17afhhel01171_.mp3": "What difference does it make to you? None, I'm sure. Just find your father's holocron and you won't have to worry about me again either way.",
      "nm17afhhel01173_.mp3": "That's the kind of response I would expect. Very well. We'll look for the holocron if we have time. I can't promise any more than that.",
      "nm17afhhel01185_.mp3": "Here. Take these 500 credits. It's all I have. Go to Coruscant and find a doctor. I'll meet you there after... after what I have to do.",
      "nm17afhhel01187_.mp3": "Please, take it. I... want to see you again. When we can talk.",
      "nm17ag10cz01173_.mp3": "*whisper* Czerka may be a corrupt organization, but that doesn't justify us using the Force for personal gain.",
      "nm18ab10ta05013_.mp3": "This should be interesting...",
      "nm18ab10ta05021_.mp3": "I say leave him.",
      "nm18ab10ta05023_.mp3": "I take it back. Let's congratulate his wife.",
      "nm18abbast14000_.mp3": "So we have found it. Father's holocron. I suppose I should be thankful the desert sands had not swallowed it up.",
      "nm18abbast14002_.mp3": "I don't know. I'll...I'll have to think about that. I'll keep it on me while I decide.",
      "nm18acstar99001_.mp3": "The Star Map is an artifact of the dark side. The krayt dragon may have been drawn here by its dark power, only to be enslaved by it.",
      "nm18acstar99002_.mp3": "Come. We should leave this place. There is nothing else for us here.",
      "nm18acstar99019_.mp3": "I do not think it is mere chance that we have found the Star Map here, in the lair of a krayt dragon.",
      "nm22aaczer03013_.mp3": "Shipped as slaves to work as soldiers and heavy laborers in Czerka camps, no doubt. \n",
      "nm22aadaso07059_.mp3": "Feeding this man's hatred is an act of malice and petty evil. The Council would not approve of your actions here, and neither do I.",
      "nm22aaelix08056_.mp3": "An honest man and a good mechanic. Seems like you got a favorable trade, sir.",
      "nm22aajano06057_.mp3": "[Force Persuade] You wish to tell us more about this agreement with the Wookiee leadership.",
      "nm22aajano06096_.mp3": "It's not our place to judge, Carth. As he said, it would change nothing anyway.",
      "nm22aajano06098_.mp3": "Of course not. I would gladly end it, had I the power. However, we are here for other reasons, if you will recall.",
      "nm22aazaal01044_.mp3": "Perhaps you should reconsider leaving Zaalbar behind. This is, after all, his homeworld.",
      "nm22aazaal01046_.mp3": "We know very little of this planet. I also sense that Zaalbar has much that is unresolved here... it may be beneficial to aid him in this respect.",
      "nm22aazaal01049_.mp3": "Is this about power, then? You would rather make a decision for the sake of making it than make it wisely?",
      "nm22aazaal01051_.mp3": "I am only suggesting that both we and Zaalbar would benefit from his company while on Kashyyyk. You do want to find the Star Map, don't you?",
      "nm22abdehn06016_.mp3": "Put it down? You... you murdered him?",
      "nm22abdehn06112_.mp3": "*whisper* I do not approve of this game you are playing! This Wookiee's death is a tragedy, not a chance for your profit.",
      "nm22abzaal01028_.mp3": "This place is so wonderful, yet so strange. Maybe we should have Zaalbar with us. A guide with local knowledge could be invaluable.",
      "nm23aawook01039_.mp3": "Surely that is no way to gain co-operation from the Wookiees. Some subtlety is not out of the question, is it?",
      "nm23abjaar01053_.mp3": "I do not like where this is leading. I fear it can only end in sorrow.",
      "nm23abwoor02048_.mp3": "I think I begin to see what has occurred here. We should speak to Jarak at once.",
      "nm23acworr01038_.mp3": "This isn't justice, it doesn't seem right! But... what else could we do?",
      "nm23acworr01058_.mp3": "How sad. It feels like the right thing to do, but... to destroy a hero...",
      "nm23acworr01141_.mp3": "You mustn't let greed rule your decision here. Justice must be served.",
      "nm23adchuu01141_.mp3": "Are you sure this is wise? To support a slaver feels... wrong.",
      "nm23adchuu01145_.mp3": "Of course not. Only the idiots around me.",
      "nm23adchuu01248_.mp3": "Then I suppose we have little choice. We should proceed with caution, however.",
      "nm23adfrey02072_.mp3": "This Wookiee does not like this line of questioning. You'll anger him past reasoning.",
      "nm23adfrey02089_.mp3": "I did warn you this wouldn't work.",
      "nm24aajole06205_.mp3": "I can feel the power of the Force within you, old man, but I do not sense the taint of the dark side. I think you are a servant of the light, despite what you claim.",
      "nm25aafrey02174_.mp3": "Wait - I don't trust Chuundar. Maybe we should try talking to this Wookiee.",
      "nm25aastar99001_.mp3": "The Star Map is an artifact of the dark side. The horrors that live here in the Shadowlands could be the result of thousands of generations affected by the Star Map's power.",

      "nm26aairim06029_.mp3": "[Force Persuade] But we are not your enemies... we are your friends. Tell us what you know.",
      "nm26aairim06061_.mp3": "So you brought these youths to the Sith. And then what did you do to them?",
      "nm26aanilk09039_.mp3": "And what if the Republic does mean harm, Carth? Will you tell them?",
      "nm26aanilk09043_.mp3": "How very noble of you.",
      "nm26aanilk09115_.mp3": "I doubt the Republic would be involved in anything illegal. Still, if this Selkath has concerns we could look into it for him.",
      "nm26aaselj17062_.mp3": "Jedi are renowned for being arbiters in times of need. We will investigate this matter as best we are able.",
      "nm26aaselj18022_.mp3": "'Almost seems'? They do wish to conquer everything, and will not stop at Manaan. Why the Selkath believe themselves invulnerable I have no idea.",
      "nm26aaselj21036_.mp3": "If you had listened, Carth, you would know that that *is* the law. Sunry is guilty until proven innocent.",
      "nm26aaselj21040_.mp3": "Angering the judge won't get us a more impartial decision, Carth.",
      "nm26aasunr26069_.mp3": "And you would propose what? Letting a murderer free on the chance it will help the Republic?",
      "nm26aasunr26071_.mp3": "But you're willing to overlook it. Are the principles that the Republic stands on so very weak, Carth?",
      "nm26acignu04077_.mp3": "I know you want to help Sunry, but we should not be manufacturing evidence like this.",
      "nm27aashas06020_.mp3": "Yes... certainly you must have heard of the destruction of Taris. It is your 'honorable' friends that committed that atrocity.",
      "nm27aashas06036_.mp3": "[Persuade] Wait! If you do not allow us time to prove our claims, you act just like you claim the Sith not to be!",
      "nm27aashas06047_.mp3": "I can understand why you're doing this, but surely it can't be that hard to *prove* the evil of the dark side, can it?",
      "nm27aashas06066_.mp3": "Use the Force, then. Look into your heart and you will realize what is truth and what is lies.",
      "nm27aashas06080_.mp3": "You have been saved from more than you know. Given time, the Sith would have turned you fully to the dark side... and you would have betrayed your world gladly.",
      "nm27aashas06108_.mp3": "*whisper* How does promoting the Sith help our cause? Think about what you are doing!",
      "nm28absur201006_.mp3": "Changed inside them? Yes... this whole place feels wrong, somehow.",
      "nm28acsur303027_.mp3": "How horrible! I can only imagine how frightened you were.",
      "nm33aapros18014_.mp3": "That is unworthy of you. And it draws unwanted attention.",
      "nm33aapros18021_.mp3": "That is murder, and this young person is not even a Sith!",
      "nm33aapros18023_.mp3": "That is beside the point.",
      "nm33aashaa19033_.mp3": "What? Why didn't you try to help them?!",
      "nm33aayuth21107_.mp3": "I... yes -- we are only servants to the... master.",
      "nm33abacad01010_.mp3": "Ahh... ignore him, sir. He is mentally deficient. And he drools.",
      "nm33abmeke02008_.mp3": "Disgusting and barbaric. That these men chose to do this willingly astounds me to no end.",
      "nm33abmeke02010_.mp3": "And what is that supposed to mean?",
      "nm33abmeke02012_.mp3": "Never mind what I thought. Just be quiet.",
      "nm33abmekf03018_.mp3": "That was a kind thing to do. Better he give up on the Sith while he can.",
      "nm33abmekf03034_.mp3": "What are you doing? This man is not even a Sith, in truth. This is beneath contempt.",
      "nm33abmekf03055_.mp3": "That's madness! How long have you been here?",
      "nm35aabast06000_.mp3": "I know we have not spoken often during our time together, despite my best efforts. And to this point I have respected your privacy. But there is something we must discuss.",
      "nm35aabast06003_.mp3": "No, this cannot wait any longer. You have no understanding of what we are going up against; I will not allow you to go in unprepared!",
      "nm35aabast06005_.mp3": "I feel the end of our quest is near. Soon we will discover the location of the Star Forge; though what will happen next is... uncertain.",
      "nm35aabast06006_.mp3": "I've been watching you. I've seen how you have resisted great temptations and continue to walk the path of the light side. Very commendable.",
      "nm35aabast06008_.mp3": "My role in what you will become is a small one. I can only give you the warnings taught to me by my own master, ultimately it is your own actions that will decide your fate.",
      "nm35aabast06010_.mp3": "The path of the light is a difficult one to walk. We might not even see the shadows until we are surrounded and can never find our way back.",
      "nm35aabast06011_.mp3": "I've been watching you. I've seen you give in to temptation and indulge your baser emotions on many occassions. I'm afraid you are on the path that leads to the dark side.",
      "nm35aabast06014_.mp3": "How can I help?",
      "nm35aabast06016_.mp3": "About my mother? I am unsure. I seem to find it difficult to remain objective when it comes to her. I find that... disturbing.",
      "nm35aabast06018_.mp3": "We have more important things to do. Still... my father is dead. Just because we find the holocron doesn't mean I have to give it to her.",
      "nm35aabast06020_.mp3": "Father recorded all his personal thoughts in that holocron even when I knew him. Having it would be like having him with you.",
      "nm35aabast06021_.mp3": "I don't see why she deserves it, however. She drove him to his death. I loved him... and I didn't even have a chance to say goodbye.",
      "nm35aabast06023_.mp3": "I don't know. Part of me would keep it just so she didn't get it. I don't like that part of me.",
      "nm35aabast06024_.mp3": "I would have thought my Jedi training would have put me past this kind of pettiness. I wish... I really don't want to think about this.",
      "nm35aabast06025_.mp3": "Please, let's just keep going.",
      "nm35aabast06027_.mp3": "It does, doesn't it? I can't seem to help myself.",
      "nm35aabast06029_.mp3": "Yes... maybe. I don't feel good about it, still.",
      "nm35aabast06031_.mp3": "Do you think I should?",
      "nm35aabast06033_.mp3": "That would just lead into another argument. How I always despised talking to her.",
      "nm35aabast06035_.mp3": "I would like to keep something to remember Father as much as she would.",
      "nm35aabast06037_.mp3": "I find myself agreeing with you, but I don't like how that feels.",
      "nm35aabast06038_.mp3": "I'll think about it. I should... try and remember my training. I should be able to let go of this, but I can't.",
      "nm35aabast06040_.mp3": "I have my doubts as to whether she's actually sick.",
      "nm35aabast06042_.mp3": "Mother used to lie about many things to get her way. She is a selfish woman who pushed my father into doing what she wished.",
      "nm35aabast06044_.mp3": "Yes, I... thought I had let go of that anger. All my training, and it comes back so quickly...",
      "nm35aabast06045_.mp3": "I don't want to talk about this any more. Let's... keep going.",
      "nm35aabast06047_.mp3": "I told you that my mother and I never got along. Obviously that has not changed.",
      "nm35aabast06048_.mp3": "And now Father is dead. That... leaves a hurt inside, you just can't imagine. I haven't seen him in so long...",
      "nm35aabast06050_.mp3": "You're probably right. There are more important things to do. Mother can wait.",
      "nm35aabast06051_.mp3": "How can I help?",
      "nm35aabast06053_.mp3": "Hmm? Sorry, I am just thinking about my mother. It is strange to hear news after all this time. It is quite distracting.",
      "nm35aabast06054_.mp3": "Should we have the opportunity, I would like to find her on Tatooine. There is only one small colony there; it should not be difficult.",
      "nm35aabast06055_.mp3": "It's not that I look forward to seeing her, I just can't help but wonder what she wants. But... perhaps we have better things to do.",
      "nm35aabast06056_.mp3": "How can I help?",
      "nm35aabast06058_.mp3": "The surface of Taris is covered with an urban skyscrape. Its glittering spires belie the decay that lies in its lower reaches, however.",
      "nm35aabast06059_.mp3": "Beyond that, there is little else I can tell you.",
      "nm35aabast06060_.mp3": "Dantooine is a peaceful and pastoral planet. There are few large communities. Mostly what you will find here are ranchers and farmers.",
      "nm35aabast06061_.mp3": "I find it a tranquil place like few in the galaxy. The perfect site for the Jedi enclave. You will like it here.",
      "nm35aabast06062_.mp3": "Manaan is a water world inhabited by an aquatic race known as the Selkath. Their only surface city and spaceport is called Ahto.",
      "nm35aabast06063_.mp3": "It is unique in that the Selkath are firm in their neutrality. They are neither part of the republic nor controlled by the Sith, and they wish to keep it that way.",
      "nm35aabast06064_.mp3": "Tatooine is a dry planet that has not been inhabited long and has little law. This town of Anchorhead may be its only settlement.",
      "nm35aabast06065_.mp3": "Kashyyyk is a planet where most of what you see is actually foliage that has grown to enormous heights. No one has ever been to the true surface of the planet below.",
      "nm35aabast06066_.mp3": "Korriban is a sparsely populated planet controlled by the Sith. It feels... wrong. There is an old evil here that permeates the Force.",
      "nm35aabast06067_.mp3": "There's nothing I could say that would be helpful, I'm afraid.",
      "nm35aabast06069_.mp3": "I can try. What would you like me to recall?",
      "nm35aabast06071_.mp3": "I shall do my best. Calm your mind and remember...",
      "nm35aabast06073_.mp3": "I shall do my best. Calm your mind and remember...",
      "nm35aabast06075_.mp3": "I shall do my best. Calm your mind and remember...",
      "nm35aabast06077_.mp3": "I shall do my best. Calm your mind and remember...",
      "nm35aabast06079_.mp3": "Yes. That brought me a lot of peace. More than I thought it would have.",
      "nm35aabast06080_.mp3": "Thank you for urging me towards it. After all my training, I would have thought it would have been easier. Apparently I still have much to learn.",
      "nm35aabast06082_.mp3": "Yes, but I don't feel any better. After all my training, I would have thought myself above such anger.",
      "nm35aabast06083_.mp3": "For it to come so easily disturbs me greatly. I don't need a holocron to remember my father, and I will never see Mother again.",
      "nm35aabast06084_.mp3": "Have I learned nothing? It... no, I don't want to talk about this. Thank you, but I must think about what I have done.",
      "nm35aabast06086_.mp3": "It was less of a dream and more of a vision... a vision the two of us shared. But I am certainly willing to answer any questions the Jedi Council did not.",
      "nm35aabast06088_.mp3": "Are you wondering why we shared the vision? Or why we even received it in the first place?",
      "nm35aabast06089_.mp3": "To the first I can only repeat the answer that the Council gave us. Our fates are linked, and for two as strong as we are in the Force that amounts to a near-physical bond.",
      "nm35aabast06090_.mp3": "As to the second, I don't truly have an answer for you. The Force works as it will, and perhaps we should be grateful for what we have been given.",
      "nm35aabast06092_.mp3": "I... I don't know. Believe me, I certainly don't find the prospect of being joined to you enjoyable in any fashion.",
      "nm35aabast06094_.mp3": "Please forgive me. I did not mean to imply that you were repulsive in any sense of the word. That we shared something so personal is just not something I'm used to.",
      "nm35aabast06096_.mp3": "Then perhaps the sooner we see to our destiny the sooner that we can proceed on our separate paths. That seems the logical solution, no?",
      "nm35aabast06098_.mp3": "The Force often seems to cause events that bend the laws of probability, especially with those that are strongly affiliated with it.",
      "nm35aabast06099_.mp3": "In this respect, you and I will simply have to become accustomed to such 'convienience'. We are the tools of the Force and we will do as it wills.",
      "nm35aabast06101_.mp3": "The Force does not compel obedience. You have a destiny, but the choices you make along it are ultimately your own.",
      "nm35aabast06103_.mp3": "Quite the contrary. Ours is the ultimate free will. The Force is our destiny, but the choices we make along it are ultimately our own.",
      "nm35aabast06105_.mp3": "There is no evidence one way or the other. What you believe the Force to be ultimately will decide who you are.",
      "nm35aabast06107_.mp3": "What would you like to know?",
      "nm35aabast06110_.mp3": "Perhaps because we desired to. Perhaps because they came to this planet and were strong enough in the Force to leave a... a trace.",
      "nm35aabast06112_.mp3": "That would not be my first choice, either, but choice appears to be irrelevant in this matter.",
      "nm35aabast06113_.mp3": "We dreamed about Revan and Malak either because we were meant to or because we needed to. There is no other way to look at it.",
      "nm35aabast06115_.mp3": "They did something important here, of that I am certain. It may be simply that we are sensitive to that event. Or it may not.",
      "nm35aabast06117_.mp3": "And what else should we dream about except that which is most important to our fate?",
      "nm35aabast06119_.mp3": "I have no idea. It was obviously important, however. That is why we must investigate this further.",
      "nm35aabast06121_.mp3": "And are you so certain that it is not you in my dreams?",
      "nm35aabast06123_.mp3": "I see. That is most likely vanity speaking, for I am not certain, myself. Regardless, our fates are linked... the vision was no doubt meant for us both.",
      "nm35aabast06125_.mp3": "Regardless of which it is, our fates are linked... the vision was doubtless meant for us both.",
      "nm35aabast06127_.mp3": "With luck we will.",
      "nm35aabast06128_.mp3": "I would rather not rely on such visions to guide us, but when we have so little else to go on and the galaxy hangs in the balance...",
      "nm35aabast06130_.mp3": "As you wish. We really should return our thoughts to business, anyway.",
      "nm35aabast06135_.mp3": "I would like to know what happened after you crashed on Taris. I'm curious as to what you and Carth were doing before we all joined forces.",
      "nm35aabast06137_.mp3": "I managed to free myself, as I recall. In fact, if I hadn't been there Brejik and his thugs might have killed you in that fight. It's probably more accurate to say that I rescued you.",
      "nm35aabast06139_.mp3": "I'll admit that I probably wouldn't have been able to free myself if not for the brawl after the swoop race. I guess I should thank you for that, at least.",
      "nm35aabast06146_.mp3": "Yes, I realize that of course. But surely there was more to it than a simple search. I doubt there were flashing signs pointing you in my direction; yet somehow you found me.",
      "nm35aabast06148_.mp3": "Yes... well. I hardly consider myself a damsel in distress. I'm a member of the Jedi Order, after all. But I won't deny you've impressed me with what you've done.",
      "nm35aabast06153_.mp3": "When you were chosen to join this mission, I doubt any of us expected this much from you. A Jedi could have done such things, of course. But only by drawing heavily upon the Force.",
      "nm35aabast06183_.mp3": "No, not bothering me. Not exactly. I've been thinking about what the Jedi Council said about the two of us. ",
      "nm35aabast06184_.mp3": "There is a bond between us, I do not dispute that. I can feel it, as I'm sure you can. The nature of that bond and its effect on our mission remain in question.",
      "nm35aabast06186_.mp3": "Necessary, perhaps, but it is no guarantee of our success. I admit, I'm a little disturbed that such a bond could be possible in the first place.",
      "nm35aabast06188_.mp3": "Deny it if you will, but there is a connection between us. I understand why you would find this disturbing. I have my own reservations about it, to be honest.",
      "nm35aabast06190_.mp3": "Our fates are strongly connected; so connected that a literal bond has been forged between us.",
      "nm35aabast06191_.mp3": "I saw your service records when you were transferred aboard the Endar Spire, but nothing beyond that. I know very little about you. I'd like to ask you some questions, given our relationship. ",
      "nm35aabast06193_.mp3": "I was referring to the bond we share; the one the Jedi Council spoke of. If I actually was interested in you, rest assured I could come up with a better approach than this!",
      "nm35aabast06211_.mp3": "Good. On which planet were you born?",
      "nm35aabast06213_.mp3": "Excellent. Your current age is?",
      "nm35aabast06215_.mp3": "Yes, well... The truth is I was studying *how* you responded to my questions. Your reactions help me judge you; this was a test for me to learn more about your character.",
      "nm35aabast06217_.mp3": "You were honest, which is good. And you treated this as a serious matter, which it is. This bond we share will shape both our destinies, it is not to be taken lightly.",
      "nm35aabast06224_.mp3": "I see you intend to be childish about this. I guess I won't get anywhere continuing our discussion right now, will I?",
      "nm35aabast06226_.mp3": "Why would you refuse to answer? These are simple questions, nothing too intrusive. First, what kind of background do you have?",
      "nm35aabast06229_.mp3": "I see. I didn't mean to upset you, but I suppose it was inevitable. You've had a lot to absorb since we escaped Taris. I apologize.",
      "nm35aabast06232_.mp3": "I do. How did you know?",
      "nm35aabast06234_.mp3": "A... a kinrath pup?! It most certainly is not!",
      "nm35aabast06235_.mp3": "I am a Jedi, remember? I have far too much mental discipline to reveal what goes on inside my mind with such obvious physical clues.",
      "nm35aabast06237_.mp3": "Our connection allows us glimpses into each other's mind. We can feel some of what the other feels. And what I feel within you troubles me.",
      "nm35aabast06238_.mp3": "A Padawan must receive considerable training. They must learn to control their emotions and darker impulses. Often it takes years before using the Force can be considered safe.",
      "nm35aabast06239_.mp3": "The fact that you are so strong in the Force and have had such relatively little training could have terrible consequences. For you, and for everyone around you.",
      "nm35aabast06241_.mp3": "This is not a joke! The choices you make could affect both our destinies, not to mention the fate of the Republic and the entire galaxy! There is much at stake.",
      "nm35aabast06243_.mp3": "No? Self-control is a maxim for all Jedi. It is what gives us the strength to resist the dark side. All who have fallen from our Order have shown a flagrant disregard for such control.",
      "nm35aabast06245_.mp3": "I don't think there is much you can do. If things were different I would recommend several years of training under one of the Jedi Masters. But I fear that won't be possible.",
      "nm35aabast06246_.mp3": "Already you exhibit the kind of willfullness, erratic behavior and lack of compassion that will lead you to corruption.",
      "nm35aabast06247_.mp3": "Thankfully you have exhibited a degree of compassion and self-control up to this point. I sincerely hope you can maintain these traits in the future.",
      "nm35aabast06248_.mp3": "We must all resist the influence of the dark side! It is everything we are fighting against! This is doubly important for you, with your natural affinity for the Force!",
      "nm35aabast06250_.mp3": "I'm sorry if I come across as harsh. But I am concerned. For you, for our mission. And for myself, as well.",
      "nm35aabast06252_.mp3": "I am not trying to harass you. But you must understand the trials and perils that lie ahead. For you, and for me.",
      "nm35aabast06254_.mp3": "That is good to hear. Without the proper training, however, I'm afraid you will find the path difficult even with the best of intentions. There is great danger ahead, for both of us.",
      "nm35aabast06255_.mp3": "Our destinies are intertwined. Everything one of us does will have consequences for the other. Any reckless behavior on your part is likely to affect me as well.",
      "nm35aabast06257_.mp3": "That's not true. I am worried about myself, but also about you. I would rather see neither of us come to any harm.",
      "nm35aabast06259_.mp3": "Yes, that is true. I will do my best to guide you, but I am no Master. Not yet. And there are times when I find the sheer strength of your power almost overwhelming.",
      "nm35aabast06261_.mp3": "I believe you truly mean what you say. For now. But sometimes it is not so easy to keep such promises.",
      "nm35aabast06262_.mp3": "Your power could be a gift or a curse. When you need guidance, or advice, or support I will do my best to help you stay on the path of the light.",
      "nm35aabast06266_.mp3": "No, of course not. Not yet. But there will be challenges ahead that might make it otherwise.",
      "nm35aabast06268_.mp3": "Why do you still try to deny the existence of this bond between us? Like it or not, we are linked... as our shared vision of the Star Map proved.",
      "nm35aabast06272_.mp3": "I am a Jedi. I am far too disciplined to betray my emotions with outward physical displays. We both know the real reason you have some idea of what I am thinking: the bond we share.",
      "nm35aabast06276_.mp3": "Yes, I did. I wanted to speak to you about our mission. About what lies ahead for us. It seems fate, or the Force, is driving us into a confrontation with the Dark Lord.",
      "nm35aabast06294_.mp3": "It's true that, due to my Battle Meditation, I was with the Jedi strike team that boarded Revan's ship. We did not kill Revan, however.",
      "nm35aabast06296_.mp3": "Our mission was to capture Revan, if possible. It was Malak who turned on his own master, firing upon Revan's ship while we were still on board it.",
      "nm35aabast06297_.mp3": "It was his desire to kill us and his master both. Thankfully we narrowly escaped the vessel as it exploded.",
      "nm35aabast06299_.mp3": "As I said, we were there to capture Revan alive. The Jedi do not believe in killing their prisoners. No one deserves execution, no matter what their crimes.",
      "nm35aabast06300_.mp3": "Remember that Revan and Malak were once great Jedi. Heroes in every sense of the word. They demonstrate the danger of the dark side to us all.",
      "nm35aabast06301_.mp3": "I'm sorry. We really shouldn't speak of this anymore. The memory of my confrontation with Revan is... painful. Let's return to the mission, please.",
      "nm35aabast06303_.mp3": "True, I suppose. And yet the outcome of that battle was... unexpected. To all of us. Revan's end was... unforeseen.",
      "nm35aabast06310_.mp3": "You must prepare yourself for when we face Malak. The confrontation will be difficult for you. I remember how hard it was when I first faced Revan.",
      "nm35aabast06315_.mp3": "Yes, I suppose I can understand your curiosity, given the bond that connects us. Very well, I'll tell you a bit about myself.",
      "nm35aabast06317_.mp3": "I was found to be strong with the Force at a young age, as most Padawans are. As a girl I was given to the Order to be trained.",
      "nm35aabast06318_.mp3": "When I joined the Order I left my family on Talravin, as all Padawans do. My family is still there, the last that I heard. I have had little contact with them, as it is discouraged.",
      "nm35aabast06320_.mp3": "Relationships with family members are fraught with powerful emotions. Such extremes are to be avoided. Anger and hate are the worst, but even love can lead to folly.",
      "nm35aabast06322_.mp3": "Emotional entanglements can be dangerous. They can impair rational thought, they can lead to outbursts of uncontrolled emotion. A Jedi must be above such things.",
      "nm35aabast06325_.mp3": "The gift of the Force comes with a high cost. Sacrifice of one's emotional attachments is one of the prices a Jedi must be willing to pay. The alternative is to fall prey to the dark side.",
      "nm35aabast06327_.mp3": "Please, you mustn't say things like that. The dark side is destruction and chaos, the opposite of all that gives the universe order and purpose. You have to understand this.",
      "nm35aabast06329_.mp3": "And you need to be more mindful of your responsibilities! Have you any idea of the danger a fallen Jedi represents? Not only to yourself, but to others as well?",
      "nm35aabast06331_.mp3": "That is something every Jedi should be afraid of. ",
      "nm35aabast06337_.mp3": "Like all who join the Order, I have learned to embrace the life I have chosen. I had to let go of my attachments to my family.",
      "nm35aabast06339_.mp3": "It can be a hard lesson to learn. I was not on good terms with all of my family, but I do remember missing my father terribly for a very long time.",
      "nm35aabast06341_.mp3": "I was not on good terms with my mother. I was only a little girl when I left, but I was old enough to resent her and the way she treated my father.",
      "nm35aabast06342_.mp3": "She pushed my father into treasure hunting. I spent all my young life on ships traveling from one false lead to the next.",
      "nm35aabast06343_.mp3": "She whittled away my father's entire fortune, and I hated her for it. I think she was relieved to give me to the Jedi, but my father was heartbroken.",
      "nm35aabast06345_.mp3": "Very close. I was only a little girl when I left my family, but I still remember him fondly. He was kind and gentle and doted on me. My mother, however, was different.",
      "nm35aabast06347_.mp3": "You were the one who asked to know more about me! Very well, if you have changed your mind then I suppose we should just get back to our mission.",
      "nm35aabast06348_.mp3": "A child is too young to understand the sacrifices that must be made. It is better if they have no contact with their family once they are removed.",
      "nm35aabast06350_.mp3": "Once I was older I realized the wisdom of this policy. A Jedi must do what is needed, personal desires notwithstanding. Love can only obscure and confuse the matter.",
      "nm35aabast06353_.mp3": "I... I do not wish to discuss this anymore. I would rather return to our mission.",
      "nm35aabast06355_.mp3": "Even a Jedi cannot always control the feelings of the heart. We must do our best to guard against it, no matter what the cost. But some sacrifices are harder than others.",
      "nm35aabast06365_.mp3": "I do. I've been watching you. Studying you closely to see what kind of progress you have made since your training at the hands of Master Zhar.",
      "nm35aabast06367_.mp3": "I've seen how you have resisted many temptations and continue to walk the path of the light side. Very commendable, but I'm afraid you might stray from this path.",
      "nm35aabast06368_.mp3": "I've seen you give in to temptation and indulge your baser emotions on many occasions. I'm afraid you are on the path that leads to the dark side.",
      "nm35aabast06371_.mp3": "We must, for all our sakes. If you had the proper training under a true Master you would know all this. But because of our mission, I must be the one to try and help you understand.",
      "nm35aabast06375_.mp3": "You need to see what the dark side represents in its entirety, for it is what we battle. Only the wisdom of a Jedi Master can truly explain this, but I will do my best to make you understand.",
      "nm35aabast06376_.mp3": "The dark side is not simply giving in to anger or temptation to use the Force to destructive ends. These things only lead to the dark side.",
      "nm35aabast06377_.mp3": "The dark side grows stronger and more insidious the closer you draw to it. It begs you to surrender to it, to release all its terrible power... and it becomes harder and harder to resist.",
      "nm35aabast06378_.mp3": "And once you stop resisting, it is too late. It twists you up inside and... and turns you into a mockery of everything you once stood for.",
      "nm35aabast06380_.mp3": "I am no less resistant to temptation than any other. I simply have the benefit of training that you do not. But even the training of the Jedi might not be enough to save us.",
      "nm35aabast06382_.mp3": "We need only to look at the atrocities which have been committed by those under its sway to understand the terrible, corrupting evil of the dark side.",
      "nm35aabast06383_.mp3": "Millions dead, and far more suffering. What sort of person would you have to become to perform such deeds gladly?",
      "nm35aabast06385_.mp3": "One who serves the light side does not strike down an innocent. We take arms against the dark side and the injustice that follows it only.",
      "nm35aabast06387_.mp3": "Neither do I, and I hope I never do.",
      "nm35aabast06389_.mp3": "And how adept must one become at making excuses for one's actions, if suffering is the result? How long before you stop making excuses at all?",
      "nm35aabast06391_.mp3": "And that is why the dark side is so insidious. If you are not careful, you do not even see each small step you take towards it until it is too late.",
      "nm35aabast06392_.mp3": "It is so easy to think that we would never fall prey to such a horror; that we have unlimited control, vigilance and foresight. If only that were true.",
      "nm35aabast06393_.mp3": "The Sith have become powerful because there are many Jedi who have succumbed to the lure of the dark side and joined their cause.",
      "nm35aabast06394_.mp3": "What greater weapon is there than to turn an enemy to your cause? To use their own knowledge against them?",
      "nm35aabast06395_.mp3": "We are weakened while they are strengthened. So we must harden our hearts and do whatever is required to fight against the dark side. Even when the battle becomes wearying.",
      "nm35aabast06397_.mp3": "I don't know. The vision of our future is clouded by shadows cast from the dark side. But I sense something ominous lurking in those shadows.",
      "nm35aabast06398_.mp3": "But words alone cannot save one from the dark side. Come, we should continue with the task at hand. When the time comes I only hope we are all strong enough to do what we must.",
      "nm35aabast06400_.mp3": "No, I suppose not. I have spoken more than enough of the dark side. It is up to you whether you heed my words or not.",
      "nm35aabast06402_.mp3": "You say you understand, but I'm afraid you are taking this too lightly. The power of the dark side can be... alluring.",
      "nm35aabast06405_.mp3": "Why? I could not accomplish this on my own, I need the aid of others - especially one who is strong in the Force. The bond between us made you a natural choice.",
      "nm35aabast06409_.mp3": "I admit, there were times that I wondered if this is more than just a mission to stop Malak. There were times when I wondered if this was also a way for the Council to test my own abilities.",
      "nm35aabast06411_.mp3": "You must learn to trust in the wisdom of the Council. Your destiny will come in its appointed time. You mustn't be so impatient.",
      "nm35aabast06413_.mp3": "*Must* you be so frustrating? I admit, I had a moment of foolish pride. But I'm over it. Now I am focused on my true responsibilities.",
      "nm35aabast06414_.mp3": "I am simply trying to help you and complete this mission, and yet you battle me at every turn!",
      "nm35aabast06416_.mp3": "Fun?! Fun?! Driving me insane is your idea of a good time?",
      "nm35aabast06418_.mp3": "You... you are a very odd man, do you know that? I simply don't know how to deal with you. All I want to do is help you, but you seem determined to drive me mad.",
      "nm35aabast06421_.mp3": "Unfortunately it isn't as easy as that. But your point is well taken.",
      "nm35aabast06422_.mp3": "Come on, come, let's move on... there's much to be done.",
      "nm35aabast06424_.mp3": "I don't know if I should be outraged that you keep joking about serious matters, or if I should be grateful that you can always lighten the mood.",
      "nm35aabast06427_.mp3": "I must admit: I simply don't know how to deal with someone like you.",
      "nm35aabast06435_.mp3": "I started it? You were the one who brought up the issue of the Council! You were the one who questioned our mission! You're the one who mocked me for thinking I was being tested!",
      "nm35aabast06443_.mp3": "I do. I have been trying to come up with the best way to say this for some time, but I suppose I should just come out and say it.",
      "nm35aabast06444_.mp3": "The truth is, I have come to depend on you. Not just for the sake of the mission, but for my own sake as well. I am... I am glad you are with us.",
      "nm35aabast06446_.mp3": "Well, yes. Surely that is not so surprising.",
      "nm35aabast06448_.mp3": "No, I'm not. Why must you make this so difficult for me? Can't you just accept a simple compliment?",
      "nm35aabast06453_.mp3": "Now you're teasing me. You know very well what I said.",
      "nm35aabast06457_.mp3": "Did I? I am trying to be sincere, here. It occurred to me that I may have been too critical of you. Too demanding, at times.",
      "nm35aabast06459_.mp3": "I am trying my best. You are not making this easy for me, you know.",
      "nm35aabast06463_.mp3": "I see. Is there nothing I can do to make it up to you? I would rather we were friends.",
      "nm35aabast06465_.mp3": "What? But I... alright. Have it your way, if that's what you'd prefer. We needn't talk further.",
      "nm35aabast06468_.mp3": "I... you know I can't feel that way about you. About any man. It isn't permitted. I am a Jedi, I must resist these temptations.",
      "nm35aabast06469_.mp3": "But I still want to consider you a friend. We could... we could never be anything more, though. That... that isn't allowed.",
      "nm35aabast06474_.mp3": "I know my manner can be a bit taciturn. I know you must be getting sick of my lectures about the dark side and... and everything else.",
      "nm35aabast06475_.mp3": "I spent all my years being hounded by my instructors. Being told so often how gifted and important I was until I was sick of it.",
      "nm35aabast06476_.mp3": "I remember when I was younger I used to swear that I would never become as self-absorbed and stodgy as the Jedi Masters. It's ironic, really.",
      "nm35aabast06478_.mp3": "That's kind of you to say, but I know for myself that it's not really true.",
      "nm35aabast06480_.mp3": "I suppose not. But I am becoming like that, though it's not easy for me to admit.",
      "nm35aabast06482_.mp3": "Yes, well... there's no need for you to agree so whole-heartedly.",
      "nm35aabast06483_.mp3": "Being controlled has kept everyone around me at an arm's length; even those like yourself who are most in need of my understanding and compassion.",
      "nm35aabast06484_.mp3": "But maybe it's time to change that. You deserve to know how much I respect and admire you. I thought... I just thought I should tell you.",
      "nm35aabast06488_.mp3": "Well, that was not nearly so difficult as I feared. Thank you for hearing me out. I feel... I feel much better.",
      "nm35aabast06490_.mp3": "Am I so transparent? I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, considering our bond. Yes, there is something I would like to ask, if you'll permit it.",
      "nm35aabast06492_.mp3": "Don't even start with that. You're the one who asked. I wasn't even going to say anything. But now that you've brought it up, I see I shouldn't have waited as long as I have.",
      "nm35aabast06494_.mp3": "In our time together I've been watching you. I've seen your tendency towards giving in to your darker emotions. You do as you please, for the most part.",
      "nm35aabast06495_.mp3": "Don't worry, this isn't a lead-up to a lecture. I'm... fascinated by your passion, by how easily it comes to you.",
      "nm35aabast06496_.mp3": "You seem to do whatever you want, something I would never dare consider. Don't you fear the consequences?",
      "nm35aabast06498_.mp3": "I doubt my old Master would approve of your advice. Besides, I'm not like you. I must always be on guard against such outbursts.",
      "nm35aabast06500_.mp3": "Is it? The thought of what could happen to me if I lose control... somehow I think life could be very long, indeed.",
      "nm35aabast06502_.mp3": "That... that's a relief to hear. That you would even be willing to risk so much is... is very brave. Braver than I could be.",
      "nm35aabast06503_.mp3": "In our time together I've been watching you. You are a true servant of the light, you follow the tenets of the Jedi Order despite the lure of the dark side. And with so little training.",
      "nm35aabast06504_.mp3": "For me it has always been a constant battle. Don't you find it difficult at all? You make it seem so easy. Or is that only an illusion?",
      "nm35aabast06506_.mp3": "And that's enough for you? If only it were as easy for me. If only the right path was always clear.",
      "nm35aabast06508_.mp3": "That's a relief to hear. I have never found the Jedi path an easy one to walk, and it's good to know I'm not alone.",
      "nm35aabast06510_.mp3": "You don't? Sometimes I find that it is nearly all I can think of. I have never found the Jedi training easy to master.",
      "nm35aabast06511_.mp3": "I've always struggled for control over my passions. I've always been too quick to anger, too quick to get involved. My instructors constantly berated me for it.",
      "nm35aabast06512_.mp3": "I've often dreamed that I might be able to confront Darth Malak myself. I dream I can use all this power I have to kill him and stop all the death and destruction.",
      "nm35aabast06513_.mp3": "I just think about all the evil that the Sith have caused and I... I get so furious. Yet we are told that these feelings are the path to the dark side.",
      "nm35aabast06515_.mp3": "I don't know. Would the power I used to kill Darth Malak be too tempting to keep using? Would I become the kind of evil I want to destroy?",
      "nm35aabast06517_.mp3": "But what comes next? After using all that power, would you decide to impose your own view on the universe? The dark side corrupts your very thoughts.",
      "nm35aabast06519_.mp3": "I suppose I do. Part of me thinks that it would be worth anything to vanquish evil, even if it meant giving in to my base emotions.",
      "nm35aabast06520_.mp3": "The very thought that I could become as evil as Malak; I just can't fathom it. It just doesn't seem possible. How could I... no, wait. I'm sorry.",
      "nm35aabast06521_.mp3": "I shouldn't even be asking you this. The Jedi teachings are clear; who am I to question them? And even worse, who am I to try and make you question them?",
      "nm35aabast06523_.mp3": "These are dangerous thoughts, the indulgence of a vain mind. Please, forget I ever mentioned this. Let's just return to our mission.",
      "nm35aabast06525_.mp3": "Yes, I did end that quite abruptly, didn't I? Perhaps a Master could have addressed my questions with the proper wisdom. But I never should have brought it up here. Not with you.",
      "nm35aabast06526_.mp3": "I don't think I'm the proper Jedi to guide you. I am no Master. You should have remained with the Council.",
      "nm35aabast06528_.mp3": "The fact of the matter is that I have never possessed much skill at controlling myself. With the bond that joins us, it seems I have even less.",
      "nm35aabast06530_.mp3": "Whether you will continue on your current path and fall to the dark side, I don't know. But it is increasingly obvious I am unable to guide you properly.",
      "nm35aabast06531_.mp3": "You have maintained the path of the light side. But it has been in spite of my influence, not because of it. It is increasingly obvious I am unable to guide you properly.",
      "nm35aabast06533_.mp3": "I don't know. I think... I think I may have made a very big mistake.",
      "nm35aabast06534_.mp3": "I simply hope that you are not the one who pays the price, ultimately, for the fact that I can't help you enough.",
      "nm35aabast06538_.mp3": "That's a kinder response than I deserve. And I can see there is wisdom in your words.",
      "nm35aabast06539_.mp3": "You... you continue to be there for me, don't you? Even after I keep pushing you away, you're still around when I need you most.",
      "nm35aabast06541_.mp3": "Well, just... different, I suppose. Things are not going as I thought they would. I... I need time to think about all this. ",
      "nm35aabast06542_.mp3": "Perhaps you can help me. And I will try to help you, if I can. Hopefully this will all work out, for the both of us. And for the sake of the mission.",
      "nm35aabast06545_.mp3": "That is kind of you to say, but I think the evidence speaks for itself. I think... I think I may have made a very big mistake.",
      "nm35aabast06547_.mp3": "Fair enough. You will probably be better off on your own, in any case. I won't trouble you with this anymore.",
      "nm35aabast06550_.mp3": "Perhaps you are not being truly objective, then. There is no need to spare my feelings on this point.",
      "nm35aabast06552_.mp3": "Please don't make light of this. The very fact that I am plagued by this doubt is yet further evidence of my inadequacy.",
      "nm35aabast06554_.mp3": "You have been patient with me, haven't you? I suppose you deserve an answer. But you have to understand how difficult this is for me to say.",
      "nm35aabast06561_.mp3": "With all my training, I should be able to control myself better than this. But you're not anything like I expected. You're not like any man I've ever met before.",
      "nm35aabast06562_.mp3": "I find myself watching you when I don't mean to. I'm thinking about you when I don't want to. It isn't supposed to be like this!",
      "nm35aabast06564_.mp3": "Every time I try to call on all my teachings to calm myself, they fail me. You have such power, such passion! I don't know if it's due to the bond between us, but I'm drawn to you. ",
      "nm35aabast06566_.mp3": "The Force is a part of you, as is your power. But that's not what attracted me to you. It's more than that. Maybe it's the bond we share. It gives us a certain... intimacy.",
      "nm35aabast06567_.mp3": "If I could, I would return to Dantooine. I need to be away from this bond of ours. I need to weaken it. I need to be anywhere but near you!",
      "nm35aabast06580_.mp3": "And go where? I am needed here, just as you are. There is nothing that is more important than what we are doing. Which is why we need to resolve this.",
      "nm35aabast06586_.mp3": "Oh, I thought... No, this is good. I'm glad you told me. This makes everything much easier.",
      "nm35aabast06590_.mp3": "Don't worry - I can put this behind me. Let's just continue on with what we must do. It is better this way.",
      "nm35aabast06592_.mp3": "I don't know. It shouldn't be so hard to not think of you. It should be easy to not think of you. I should have discipline! Jedi discipline!",
      "nm35aabast06596_.mp3": "Yes, I promised you an answer when we reached the Ebon Hawk, didn't I? But I'm afraid you won't like it. We should have some privacy for this.",
      "nm35aabast06598_.mp3": "I can't deny that there are parts of you I am drawn to. Your power, your will. You are so much stronger than I am.",
      "nm35aabast06599_.mp3": "In some ways you make me feel weak, like I am caught up in the wake of our destiny. But at the same time, you make me feel stronger, more alive.",
      "nm35aabast06601_.mp3": "I realize now these feelings are part of the bond we share. The Jedi Council surely realized this; they knew my loyalty to the doctrines of our Order would be tested on this mission.",
      "nm35aabast06602_.mp3": "By facing and overcoming my feelings for you I have learned a valuable lesson about control and the dangers of emotion. This is an important step in understanding the Force.",
      "nm35aabast06603_.mp3": "I'm sorry if this is not what you wanted to hear. But I felt it was important you know our... infatuation... was nothing more than a result of our powerful bond.",
      "nm35aabast06604_.mp3": "Please, don't say it like that. You make it sound like I was using you! Don't you realize how difficult this was for me?",
      "nm35aabast06614_.mp3": "You're stronger than I am, and there's no point in telling me otherwise. You will be a great Jedi, I think. I hope.",
      "nm35aabast06616_.mp3": "Then I suggest we move on.",
      "nm35aabast06617_.mp3": "I am confident that you can deal with that on your own.",
      "nm35aabast06618_.mp3": "I wish I could help you with that.",
      "nm35aautha22070_.mp3": "One has to wonder exactly what a Sith Master would find 'impressive'.",
      "nm35aautha22157_.mp3": "I can't say I approve, putting this weapon in the hands of --",
      "nm35aautha22167_.mp3": "Or innovative lying.",
      "nm35aayuth24204_.mp3": "You sound much like... someone I know.",
      "nm37aafree04049_.mp3": "What is this? A... spirit, full of the Force. Be careful. I sense an extremely old and confused mind behind this presence...",
      "nm37aafree04104_.mp3": "The ancient Sith... destroyed each other. The fundamental flaw in their philosophy, one would think.",
      "nm38aaassa01082_.mp3": "It was a pleasure to have met you, er... do you have a name?",
      "nm38abmeke03012_.mp3": "It's never too late for anyone to feel compassion... or remorse. Not even you, Mekel.",
      "nm38abmeke03043_.mp3": "It is a small mercy, Carth, and that's a start.",
      "nm40aabast01000_.mp3": "Don't try to move too quickly, you might not be fully recovered yet. Admiral Karath had his guards continue to torture you even after you passed out.",
      "nm40aabast01002_.mp3": "The dark side has perverted him, Carth. Once you start down the tainted path it leads you ever further into the depths of evil. I fear he is forever lost.",
      "nm40aabast01004_.mp3": "Yes, hmm, I suppose you are correct. Sometimes it is easy to lose sight of that hope in the face of such unbridled cruelty, but you speak the truth.",
      "nm40aabast01005_.mp3": "I suppose I'm taking the news of Dantooine's destruction quite hard. First Taris, now the Academy... is there no end to the killing?",
      "nm40aabast01007_.mp3": "I'd like to believe that Saul was lying to us, but even as he said the words I knew they were true. The Academy is gone.",
      "nm40aabast01008_.mp3": "We should have felt a disturbance in the Force when the attack came. The fact that we did not is a bad sign. I fear the dark side is growing stronger, casting shadows our vision cannot pierce.",
      "nm40aabast01009_.mp3": "I can only hope that some of the Jedi escaped. Vrook, Vandar, Zhar... I cannot imagine all of them being gone. In any case, we have lost our one place of refuge in the galaxy.",
      "nm40aabast01013_.mp3": "I only wish you had been able to resist the Admiral's questioning. I hope the information you revealed does not bring the entire galaxy under the dominion of the Sith. ",
      "nm40aabast01015_.mp3": "I appreciate your... feelings... for me. But you can't let your feelings override your judgment. Remember the Jedi code: There is no emotion, there is peace.",
      "nm40aabast01016_.mp3": "Your efforts were well intentioned but poorly thought out; Saul tortured us all anyway. There is too much at stake to let reckless passion rule our actions.",
      "nm40aabast01018_.mp3": "I know if I had been in that position I would not have betrayed the Order and the Republic!",
      "nm40aabast01024_.mp3": "I appreciate your... feelings... for Carth. But you can't let your feelings override your judgment. Remember the Jedi code: There is no emotion, there is peace.",
      "nm40aabast01028_.mp3": "Did you feel that? A disturbance in the Force. The Admiral has sent his message, the Dark Lord knows we are here now. Malak is coming.",
      "nm40aabast01036_.mp3": "Your attitude disturbs me. Such selfishness is a sign of the dark side's taint, and it does little to fill me with confidence in you.",
      "nm40aabast01038_.mp3": "It is fortunate you were able to resist the Admiral's questioning. The fate of the galaxy could be changed by revealing the slightest piece of vital information.",
      "nm40aabast01039_.mp3": "I have to confess something. There was a moment - just a moment - when part of me was hoping you would tell him what he wanted to know. Just to make the horrible pain stop.",
      "nm40aabast01041_.mp3": "I know you wouldn't ever do anything to intentionally cause me pain. But you did the right thing.",
      "nm40aabast01042_.mp3": "I don't honestly know if I could have been as strong in your position. To watch you suffer like that... it might have been too much for me to bear.",
      "nm40aabast01045_.mp3": "You wanted me to suffer? You enjoyed my torment? I don't know what to say. I thought there was a bond between us.",
      "nm40aabast01046_.mp3": "Maybe... maybe you're not the man I thought you were.",
      "nm40aabast01058_.mp3": "This is not a matter to joke about! If there is one thing we can learn from Saul it is how the power of the dark side can corrupt even the bravest of heroes!",
      "nm40aabast01059_.mp3": "I'm sorry. Forgive me. Snapping at you like that won't help our situation.",
      "nm40aabast01063_.mp3": "We better get moving. I can feel the darkness of Malak's presence approaching, and I don't want to be here when he arrives. None of us is a match for the Sith Lord.",
      "nm40aabast01065_.mp3": "Then you are a fool! The power of the Dark Lord is strong enough to destroy any of us... even you. It would be suicide to face Malak here! We need to get away before he arrives.",
      "nm40aabast01067_.mp3": "Surprise and secrecy will serve us best. A small group might have a better chance of sneaking onto the bridge undetected while the others make their way down to the Ebon Hawk.",
      "nm40aabast01070_.mp3": "That's a good idea. The others can get to the Ebon Hawk on their own, but Carth and I might need your help.",
      "nm40aabast01071_.mp3": "The three of us will get our equipment and make our way to the bridge. The rest of you head down to the docking hangar where they've got the Ebon Hawk. You'll have to find a way to deal with guards.",
      "nm40aabast01073_.mp3": "We'll meet you there as soon as we get those docking bay doors open. Just make sure the Hawk is ready to fly when we get there. And may the Force be with you.",
      "nm40aabast01075_.mp3": "That's true, Carth. You can come, but don't let your hatred of Saul Karath jeopardize our true mission: getting the Ebon Hawk safely off the Leviathan.",
      "nm40aabast01077_.mp3": "You better come with me and Carth. The others can find their way on their own, but we might run into trouble. We'll need you and your powerful Force abilities to deal with it.",
      "nm40aabast01079_.mp3": "Well done, Jolee. I knew we could count on you. A Jedi never fails to get the task done!",
      "nm40aabast01081_.mp3": "Well done, Juhani. In freeing us from the cell you have proven yourself truly worthy of the title of Jedi.",
      "nm40aacart05007_.mp3": "Talk of an escape is somewhat premature, don't you think? We don't even have a plan to get out of this mess yet!",
      "nm40aacart05011_.mp3": "Maybe Admiral Karath doesn't know how many of us there are on board. We all have special talents; talents we could exploit so that one of us could stage a rescue.",
      "nm40aacart05013_.mp3": "We just have to figure out who has the best chance to avoid capture so that they can come and rescue us later. It's a long shot, but it's our only hope.",
      "nm40aacart05015_.mp3": "The admiral will be watching the three of us far too closely for any plot involving you, me or Carth to succeed. It's going to be up to one of the others to get us out of this.",
      "nm40aacart05082_.mp3": "Is that wise? We need someone inconspicuous for this task, and Wookiees tend to draw a lot of attention... especially from arresting troops. Maybe you should go with someone else.",
      "nm40aacart05084_.mp3": "That is not the way of the Jedi. Vengeance, anger, emotion: these things lead to the dark side!",
      "nm40aasaul10016_.mp3": "We will never serve Malak or the dark side! The Sith will be destroyed, Admiral Karath... as will you if you don't turn away from this path.",
      "nm40aasaul10033_.mp3": "Don't waste your breath, Saul! We won't answer any of your questions.",
      "nm40aasaul10045_.mp3": "My pain is meaningless. Tell him nothing!",
      "nm40aasaul10064_.mp3": "No! Don't say anymore!",
      "nm40aasaul10087_.mp3": "NO! AHHH!! NO!! AUGH! The pain - THE PAIN! AHHHH!!! AUGH!",
      "nm40aasaul10113_.mp3": "Why? Why are you telling him this?",
      "nm40aasaul10117_.mp3": "Words that betray the Jedi Order bring me more pain than any torture ever could!",
      "nm40aasaul10126_.mp3": "For the sake of the Republic don't tell him anything!",
      "nm40aasaul10133_.mp3": "No! How could you betray the Jedi like this?",
      "nm40aasaul10161_.mp3": "What are you saying? Physical pain is nothing compared to the suffering of the galaxy if Malak should defeat the Jedi!",
      "nm40absaul09006_.mp3": "He speaks the truth, Carth. I can feel the Dark Lord's presence approaching.",
      "nm40absaul09016_.mp3": "The Admiral, he's still alive!",
      "nm40absaul09022_.mp3": "No, Carth, not like this! Do not give in to the hate.",
      "nm40absaul09026_.mp3": "Killing him won't ease the pain, Carth. Do not become what you despise.",
      "nm40absaul09038_.mp3": "Carth, it's not what you think. We had no other choice! Please, you don't understand...",
      "nm40absaul09042_.mp3": "Not here, Carth. Please... there's no time. Malak is coming. This isn't the place.",
      "nm40absaul09044_.mp3": "Please, Carth, I'm asking you to trust me. For just a little while longer.",
      "nm40absaul09048_.mp3": "Of course, Carth. As soon as we get to the Ebon Hawk I'll explain everything. To both of you. I promise.",
      "nm40accart02000_.mp3": "This isn't over, Malak!",
      "nm40accart02004_.mp3": "I'll hold Malak off. You two get out of here! Find the Star Forge!",
      "nm40accart02006_.mp3": "No, Bastila, he's too strong!",
      "nm40accart02008_.mp3": "For the Jedi!",
      "nm40acdart03002_.mp3": "Darth Malak!",
      "nm40acdart03028_.mp3": "It's true. I was part of the team sent to capture Revan... to capture you. When Malak fired on the ship you were badly injured. We thought you were dead.",
      "nm40acdart03030_.mp3": "Your mind was destroyed, but I used the Force to preserve the flicker of life in your body. I brought you to the Jedi Council. They were the ones who healed your damaged mind.",
      "nm40acdart03034_.mp3": "I wanted to tell you, but the Council forbid it! They were afraid you might return to the dark side if you discovered your real identity!",
      "nm40acdart03038_.mp3": "How can you say that? Malak nearly killed you, but the Jedi Council gave you another chance to live! They gave you a chance to redeem yourself by defeating the Sith!",
      "nm40acdart03043_.mp3": "The Jedi hold all life sacred, even that of a Sith Lord. I could not just let you die, Revan. Not if it was possible to save you.",
      "nm40acdart03047_.mp3": "We couldn't simply restore your true identity; Revan was too dangerous. But locked inside your mind was information the Republic needed: the secrets of the Star Forge.",
      "nm40acdart03049_.mp3": "The Council created an identity for you: a soldier under my command. Your subconscious memories were supposed to lead me to the Star Forge; there was no other way to get the information.",
      "nm40acdart03053_.mp3": "When I used my Force powers to keep you alive on that bridge it created our bond. I convinced the Council that I could use that bond to draw out your memories and lead us to the Star Forge.",
      "nm40acdart03057_.mp3": "NO! I wanted to help you, Revan. I thought this mission would redeem you; that it would atone for your past crimes. How else could you be saved?",
      "nm40acdart03059_.mp3": "You had to be healed so I could try and draw out the secrets of the Star Forge - it was our only hope of stopping the Sith! It was a risk the Council chose to take.",
      "nm40acdart03061_.mp3": "That was a risk the Council chose to take. I had to try and draw out the secrets of the Star Forge. It was our only hope of stopping the Sith! There was no other choice.",
      "nm40acdart03063_.mp3": "I used my Force powers to heal you on that bridge; we share a bond. I convinced the Council I could use our bond to draw out your memories and lead us to the Star Forge.",
      "nm40acdart03067_.mp3": "NO! I... I wanted to help you, Revan. I thought this mission would redeem you, that it would atone for your past crimes. How else could you be saved?",
      "nm41aabast01000_.mp3": "Dantooine... it seems like a lifetime since I last set foot on her surface, though in truth it has only been a few months. We should be safe from Malak here... for now, at least.",
      "nm41aabast01002_.mp3": "Even the Sith would think twice before attacking Dantooine. There are many Jedi here, including several of the most powerful Masters of the Order. There is great strength within this place.",
      "nm41aabast01004_.mp3": "We can get supplies here and recuperate. The Academy is a place of mental and spiritual healing; something we could all use after what we've been through.",
      "nm41aabast01006_.mp3": "She will find a way to come to terms with her grief. She is stronger than she appears. We just need to give her time.",
      "nm41aabast01007_.mp3": "Now I must go speak with the Council. I need their advice on... recent developments. After I have met with them I will meet you outside the ship.",
      "nm41aabast01009_.mp3": "We can't just keep running; Malak will find us eventually. We need to regroup; we need a plan.",
      "nm41aabast01010_.mp3": "The Force has given us a... a vision. Like the one we shared on Dantooine. Did you see it? Of course... you must have. The Force is strong with us both.",
      "nm41aabast01011_.mp3": "There are some who believe Korriban is the birth place of the Sith... this planet is an evil place. There are secrets here best left uncovered.",
      "nm41aabast01013_.mp3": "During the vision I felt cold and trapped; almost as if I was buried alive. It felt... it felt like we were in some kind of tomb.",
      "nm41aabast01014_.mp3": "No doubt things will become more clear once we discover the Star Map's location.",
      "nm41aabast01016_.mp3": "You are right, of course. We cannot turn away from the path we have started on... no matter where it may lead.",
      "nm41aabast01018_.mp3": "The visions are as much yours as mine - and they are the key to finding the Star Forge and stopping Malak!",
      "nm41aabast01019_.mp3": "Kashyyyk is a lush but simple and undeveloped world. I would not have expected to find the alien technology of a Star Map here.",
      "nm41aabast01021_.mp3": "The Wookiees of Kashyyyk make their home high among the Wroshyr branches; only their bravest warriors dare to descend into the forbidding depths of the forest.",
      "nm41aabast01022_.mp3": "If the Star Map is located far beneath us on the planet's surface, as our vision seems to suggest, it is unlikely the Wookiees even know of its existence.",
      "nm41aabast01024_.mp3": "Tatooine is known for little but blowing sand. I find it surprising that there would be a Star Map somewhere in its desolate wastes.",
      "nm41aabast01026_.mp3": "The Star Map would likely have to be within some kind of shelter to protect it against dust and sandstorms.",
      "nm41aabast01027_.mp3": "I suspect there are many such caves and caverns hidden in the sands of the Dune Sea. The creatures of this world probably use them as their lairs.",
      "nm41aabast01029_.mp3": "Perhaps, though that would have been tens of thousands of years in the past. Now there is nothing but the howling emptiness of the Dune Sea.",
      "nm41aabast01030_.mp3": "It is strange that anyone would have built a Star Map here; the entire surface of Manaan is covered by nothing but vast oceans.",
      "nm41aabast01032_.mp3": "The ocean floor is vast and much of it is uncharted, even by the native Selkath. But how could Revan and Malak have found their way down?",
      "nm41aabast01034_.mp3": "It is possible. The melting of polar caps or a cataclysmic earthquake could have buried the land beneath the waves eons ago. Records from that time are incomplete.",
      "nm41aabast01035_.mp3": "Another vision. The Force is guiding us, helping us retrace the steps of Malak and his old Master. Leading us ever closer to the Star Forge.",
      "nm41aabast01036_.mp3": "You felt it, yes? Another vision? The Force continues to work through us; showing us the Star Maps unearthed by Revan and Malak.",
      "nm41aacart03061_.mp3": "The Jedi Council has failed, Carth - Darth Revan has been reborn! Together we will destroy Malak and seize control of his fleet, then use it to crush the Republic!",
      "nm41aacart03062_.mp3": "Juhani and Jolee would not swear loyalty to the new ruler of the Sith. They died for their foolishness. Now swear loyalty to Darth Revan, or face your own death!",
      "nm41aacart03068_.mp3": "My, my. I think the sad fool may actually be in love with you, Revan.",
      "nm41aacart03080_.mp3": "Wait, Lord Revan. Carth speaks only for himself - he does not speak for the others. He may find he stands alone here!",
      "nm41aacart03081_.mp3": "The droids will continue to serve you Revan - they are programmed to obey their master. And there may be others who will choose to join us. ",
      "nm41aacart03082_.mp3": "The Republic is doomed, Revan has returned! Who will now swear loyalty to the second coming of the Dark Lord?",
      "nm41aacart03096_.mp3": "Let him go! We have more important things to worry about. We have to get to the Star Forge and kill Malak. Then we can turn our attention to the Republic.",
      "nm41aacart03106_.mp3": "Jolee would not swear loyalty to the new ruler of the Sith. He died for his foolishness. Now swear loyalty to Darth Revan, or face your own death!",
      "nm41aacart04061_.mp3": "The Jedi Council has failed, Carth - Darth Revan has been reborn! Together we will destroy Malak and seize control of his fleet, then use it to crush the Republic!",
      "nm41aacart04062_.mp3": "Juhani and Jolee would not swear loyalty to the new ruler of the Sith. They died for their foolishness. Now swear loyalty to Darth Revan, or face your own death!",
      "nm41aacart04080_.mp3": "Wait, Lord Revan. Carth speaks only for himself - he does not speak for the others. He may find he stands alone here!",
      "nm41aacart04081_.mp3": "The droids will continue to serve you Revan - they are programmed to obey their master. And there may be others who will choose to join us. ",
      "nm41aacart04082_.mp3": "The Republic is doomed, Revan has returned! Who will now swear loyalty to the second coming of the Dark Lord?",
      "nm41aacart04097_.mp3": "Let him go! We have more important things to worry about. We have to get to the Star Forge and kill Malak. Then we can turn our attention to the Republic.",
      "nm41aamiss04027_.mp3": "Well done, Lord Revan. You are as ruthless as Malak ever was! Quickly, now. We have to get to the Star Forge and destroy the Usurper!",
      "nm44aac02001005_.mp3": "I'll never fall to the dark side! ",
      "nm44aac02001010_.mp3": "Never!",
      "nm44aac02001015_.mp3": "You think torture will turn me, Malak? You are a fool.",
      "nm44acc01001000_.mp3": "Malak is dead - all hail the return of Darth Revan, the true Lord of the Sith!",
      "nm44acc01001001_.mp3": "The Sith bow before you, you have reclaimed your rightful throne! The Jedi Order is in tatters, ## it is only a matter of time until your Sith minions wipe them from the face of the galaxy. ## The Republic fleet is decimated, the Core Worlds are defenseless against us!",
      "nm44acevil01001_.mp3": "Revan - I knew you'd come for me. Malak thought you might be afraid to enter the Temple again, but he doesn't know you like I do. Not anymore. Not since you've changed.",
      "nm44acevil01003_.mp3": "Escape? You don't understand. I have sworn allegiance to Lord Malak and the Sith; I am no longer a pawn of the Jedi Council.",
      "nm44acevil01005_.mp3": "You say that as if the dark side is some terrible entity. The Jedi Council has brainwashed you like all the others. Like they once did with me.",
      "nm44acevil01006_.mp3": "They speak of the dark side as if it something to be feared. But in reality their only goal is to manipulate those who are strong in the Force. The fear of the dark side is a tool to maintain control.",
      "nm44acevil01007_.mp3": "Why do you think the Jedi forbid you and Malak from joining the Mandalorian Wars? They knew you would realize your true potential and break free of their domination.",
      "nm44acevil01008_.mp3": "Malak has shown me how the Jedi Council have been using me the same way they once tried to use you. They've been holding me back because they knew one day I would surpass them all.",
      "nm44acevil01012_.mp3": "I resisted at first. I endured the Sith torments with the passionless serenity of a true Jedi, emptying my mind. But after a week of endless tortures I finally saw the truth.",
      "nm44acevil01013_.mp3": "Malak forced me to acknowledge my anger and pain. He showed me the liberating power of these emotions. Then he made me see how the Jedi Council has denied me what is mine by right!",
      "nm44acevil01014_.mp3": "The Jedi Council gladly used my Battle Meditation in their wars, but they still treated me like a child - like an inferior. They were jealous of my power... of what I could become!",
      "nm44acevil01015_.mp3": "They wanted me to bow and call them Master and follow their Code and obey their every order. But all the while they were exploiting my Battle Meditation for their own use!",
      "nm44acevil01017_.mp3": "You are a sad little fool. You speak as if I were the same Bastila that you've known all along. But freed from the control of the Jedi Council I've become much, much more.",
      "nm44acevil01018_.mp3": "I almost wish you could see things as I do now. I wish you could join me and taste true power once again. Sadly, I doubt you are even capable any longer.",
      "nm44acevil01020_.mp3": "You think so, do you? You style yourself the Master of the Sith that you once were? To think I once envied you your passion, your power.",
      "nm44acevil01022_.mp3": "Lies? You are the one living a lie, Revan. The Jedi Council made you into something you are not; they programmed you to be their slave.",
      "nm44acevil01024_.mp3": "You used to be Revan, Master of the Sith, but no longer. You are simply a pawn of the Jedi Council and the Republic they serve... like I was until Malak freed me from their shackles!",
      "nm44acevil01026_.mp3": "A pity the power you once had is so diluted in you. You could have been strong as I am now... stronger, even. But that will never happen, now.",
      "nm44acevil01027_.mp3": "With the power of the Star Forge Malak will destroy the Republic and conquer the galaxy. And I will be the apprentice at his side - after I prove my worth by killing you!",
      "nm44acevil01029_.mp3": "Surely you know what I mean, Revan. Look at what the Council did to you; they turned you into their puppet. The same thing they do to all who are truly strong in the Force.",
      "nm44acevil01031_.mp3": "You are stronger than I would have thought possible, after what the Jedi Council did to you. Seems that Malak was wrong - the power of the dark side is not lost to you after all, Revan.",
      "nm44acevil01033_.mp3": "You can deny what you are, Revan, but you are only fooling yourself. I know the truth. I have seen the shadows inside your mind.",
      "nm44acevil01034_.mp3": "Remember: I was there when you nearly died in the trap set by the Jedi Council. I used the Force to preserve your life, Revan. We are forever linked by my actions on that bridge!",
      "nm44acevil01036_.mp3": "These are not your true feelings, Revan. You are speaking as a tool of the Jedi Council - as I once did. But now I see how the Jedi used us both!",
      "nm44acevil01037_.mp3": "The Council tried to exploit the bond between us. They hoped I would draw out your memories to lead them to the Star Forge. We were slaves to their will - like all who follow the Jedi Code!",
      "nm44acevil01038_.mp3": "But in our shared visions of the Star Maps I also felt the so called taint within you. I resisted it at first, but now I embrace the power of the dark side - your dark side!",
      "nm44acevil01040_.mp3": "Mistakes? No, Revan - the only mistake you are making is the one you are making now! You deny yourself the power that is yours by right! Only now do I realize how strong you are.",
      "nm44acevil01041_.mp3": "You deserve to be the true Master of the Sith, not Malak. I see this now. Together we can destroy your old apprentice. Join with me and reclaim your lost identity!",
      "nm44acevil01043_.mp3": "Your mind was too badly damaged to ever fully restore your memories, Revan. But your power, your strength of will, the essence of who and what you are: these things still remain!",
      "nm44acevil01044_.mp3": "Once long ago you defied the Jedi Council, freeing yourself from their control. You claimed your rightful title of Dark Lord of the Sith. Together we can defeat Malak and take back what is yours!",
      "nm44acevil01046_.mp3": "I... I don't. The only Revan I could respect is one who would break free of the Council's slavery. One who would grasp the power that lies before him... not the weak fool I see.",
      "nm44acevil01049_.mp3": "You are beneath my contempt, Juhani. When you felt the power of the dark side you fled to a cave like some cowering animal! You know nothing of the Force or its true potential! ",
      "nm44acevil01050_.mp3": "But you, Revan - the power of the dark side is yours to command! You can use it to destroy Malak! With my help you could rule over the entire galaxy!",
      "nm44acevil01054_.mp3": "You are beneath my contempt, old man! You hid like a coward for decades on Kashyyyk! You know nothing about the true potential of the Force!",
      "nm44acevil01057_.mp3": "Shut up, old man. Your time is over! The age of the Jedi and the Republic is no more! This is the age of Darth Revan and the Sith!",
      "nm44acevil01061_.mp3": "Kill her! Rend her flesh! Show her the fate of all who dare stand against us! Embrace the power of the dark side!",
      "nm44acevil01065_.mp3": "Kill him! Grind his old bones to dust! Show him the fate of all who dare stand against us! Embrace the dark side!",
      "nm44acevil01067_.mp3": "Yes! The sacrificial blood will consecrate this ancient temple in the name of the Sith! With the death of the Jedi the rebirth of Darth Revan will be complete!",
      "nm44acevil01070_.mp3": "Shut up, Juhani! You know nothing of the dark side's true potential! When you felt its touch you fled to a cave and cowered in terror!",
      "nm44acevil01073_.mp3": "I need deny my passions no longer, Revan. I would stand by your side gladly, as your lover and apprentice!",
      "nm44acevil01074_.mp3": "I swore allegiance to Malak only because I thought you had lost the power you had once wielded. But this... this would be much better.",
      "nm44acevil01075_.mp3": "I would be utterly yours, master! Together we would destroy Malak and you would reclaim the mantle of Dark Lord!",
      "nm44acevil01077_.mp3": "It is your power that will keep me as your loyal apprentice, Revan. I swore allegiance to Malak only because I thought you had lost the power you once wielded.",
      "nm44acevil01078_.mp3": "But you have proven yourself in our battle; I see you possess the strength to destroy Malak and reclaim the mantle of Dark Lord. Now I see you will make a worthy Sith Master. ",
      "nm44acevil01081_.mp3": "You are a pathetic fool, Revan! Together we could have defeated Malak and ruled over an Empire, but now I will be at Lord Malak's side instead!",
      "nm44acevil01082_.mp3": "You will be crushed with the Republic and all the fools who bow down to the Jedi Council! No one can stand against the power of the Star Forge and the Sith fleet!",
      "nm44acevil01086_.mp3": "Of course not! I have been reborn in the wake of destiny... *your* destiny! The power of the dark side is yours by right!",
      "nm44acevil01091_.mp3": "Our bond is not easily broken, Revan. Even when your mind was destroyed and reprogrammed with a new identity the bond between us endured.",
      "nm44acevil01093_.mp3": "Do not mistake the power of the Force for love, Revan. It does not exist. Power is what forged our bond, and power is what made us both tools of the Jedi Council!",
      "nm44acevil01096_.mp3": "Yes, Revan! I was there when you almost died in the trap set by the Jedi Council; I used the Force to preserve your life. We are forever linked by my actions on that bridge.",
      "nm44acevil01097_.mp3": "The Council tried to exploit our bond. They hoped your memories would lead me to the Star Forge. But in our shared visions of the Star Maps I also tasted the power of the taint within you!",
      "nm44acexit03000_.mp3": "You will have to disable the energy shield around this temple before we can leave. There is a computer here on the Temple summit that has access to the power generators.",
      "nm44acexit03001_.mp3": "You can also use it to disable the disruptor field that protects the Star Forge. Otherwise, the Ebon Hawk will not be able to leave the planet without crashing.",
      "nm45aabast01000_.mp3": "The fool is dead. Now there is nothing in the way of your victory!",
      "nm45aabast01001_.mp3": "Kill him, Master!!",
      "nm45aabast01002_.mp3": "The Republic knocked out the Star Forge generators! This factory is doomed! It's falling from orbit!",
      "nm45aabast01003_.mp3": "Quickly! we have to get to the Ebon Hawk before this whole complex plunges into the heart of the sun!",
      "nm45aabast01006_.mp3": "Sadly, I know this is true. Had you reclaimed the power of your previous identity I would be your apprentice, not Malak's. But you rejected the dark side.",
      "nm45aabast01007_.mp3": "Now you must pay the price. Here on the Star Forge the power of the dark side is at its strongest. This time you will not defeat me!",
      "nm45aabast01009_.mp3": "You are wasting your time. I have seen the Jedi for what they are: weak and afraid. The Sith are the true Masters of the Force. You have forgotten that lesson, Revan.",
      "nm45aabast01011_.mp3": "I have no doubt of that. I was no match for you in the Temple, but when I fled I knew you would follow me here.",
      "nm45aabast01012_.mp3": "I see now why Malak followed you. Even though you are only a shell of your former self, you are still a formidable opponent.",
      "nm45aabast01013_.mp3": "I can't even imagine the power you must have wielded when you were the Dark Lord. You were a fool to give it all up and follow the light side.",
      "nm45aabast01015_.mp3": "The dark side has made me stronger than I ever was before! I have a greater command of the Force than all but the most powerful Jedi Masters.",
      "nm45aabast01016_.mp3": "As Malak teaches me the greatest secrets of the Sith, I will unlock more of my potential. Eventually there will be no limit to what I can accomplish with the Force!",
      "nm45aabast01018_.mp3": "Have you forgotten the ways of the Sith already, Revan? Eventually I will challenge my Master. If I am worthy he will die by my hand and I will become the new Sith Master.",
      "nm45aabast01019_.mp3": "Then I will take on my own apprentice and the cycle will begin again. This is the way of the Sith, it is how we assure our leaders are always the strongest and most worthy!",
      "nm45aabast01021_.mp3": "No, Revan, it is you who are doomed!",
      "nm45aabast01023_.mp3": "Jedi propaganda. The dark side is only a tool, and Malak will train me in its use. Eventually I will surpass my Master and challenge him. If I am worthy he will die by my hand.",
      "nm45aabast01025_.mp3": "No, Revan. You are the one who will die here!",
      "nm45aabast01028_.mp3": "Then it's time for you to prove it!",
      "nm45aabast01029_.mp3": "You are growing weary, I can sense it! Your strength falters, the light side is failing you while the power of the Star Forge re-energizes me! Soon this will all be over!",
      "nm45aabast01031_.mp3": "The dark side will always triumph over the light! Malak has assured me of victory! You can't defeat me here on the Star Forge! YOU CAN'T!",
      "nm45aabast01033_.mp3": "You dare spew those Jedi lies in my face? You will die screaming, Revan!",
      "nm45aabast01036_.mp3": "What type of trick is this? ",
      "nm45aabast01039_.mp3": "I am a Sith apprentice now. You place too much faith in what I used to be... and for that you shall pay!",
      "nm45aabast01041_.mp3": "No, this is not possible! You have rejected the dark side, you are a weak and pathetic servant of the light! How can you still stand against me? Why can't I defeat you?",
      "nm45aabast01044_.mp3": "Yes, I see you speak the truth. I am no match for you. Please, for the sake of what we once shared, do not make me suffer. End my life quickly. There is no other way.",
      "nm45aabast01047_.mp3": "What other choice do you have? I have fallen to the dark side, I am the apprentice to the Dark Lord himself. You cannot let me live.",
      "nm45aabast01049_.mp3": "No... I'm not strong enough. There is too much anger inside me now. Too much hatred and fear. I can no longer find peace in the Force.",
      "nm45aabast01051_.mp3": "[Success] You... always had more strength than I did. I told you that. I felt so... helpless before your destiny.",
      "nm45aabast01052_.mp3": "You were Revan and I couldn't tell you... it was agonizing! Even worse when I began to... feel closer to you. I despised myself for it.",
      "nm45aabast01053_.mp3": "And even now I... feel your strength. It... does help me. Thank you, I think I can face the end, now. If you are the one to end it for me.",
      "nm45aabast01054_.mp3": "[Failure!] No! That bond is what took me down this path to begin with! It poisoned me... I hated myself for loving you and now I have betrayed everything!",
      "nm45aabast01056_.mp3": "[Success] I doubt mere words can help me now, but to appease you I will recite them:",
      "nm45aabast01057_.mp3": "There is no emotion: there is peace. There is no ignorance: there is knowledge. There is no passion: there is serenity. There is no chaos: there is harmony... ",
      "nm45aabast01058_.mp3": "Strange, but even now I find comfort in these words. I... suppose old habits die hard.",
      "nm45aabast01059_.mp3": "There is no death: there is the Force. Thank you, Revan. I am ready to face my fate now.",
      "nm45aabast01061_.mp3": "[Success] I... I know a flicker of the light still burns within me. Malak felt it too. He knew it could only be extinguished if I killed you.",
      "nm45aabast01062_.mp3": "But what good is a single flicker of light against the sea of darkness I am drowning in? I can never atone for my betrayal.",
      "nm45aabast01063_.mp3": "[Failure] There is nothing in my heart but the blackness of the dark side! I am sick of your preaching, Revan!",
      "nm45aabast01065_.mp3": "Yes, I... could join you in your battle against the Dark Lord. That alone would not make up for all I have done, yet... it would be a step in the right direction.",
      "nm45aabast01066_.mp3": "But how would you be able to trust me? How do you know I wouldn't turn on you when you faced Darth Malak? How do you know the dark side wouldn't make me betray you again?",
      "nm45aabast01068_.mp3": "You play a dangerous game. Are you certain you wish to take this risk? I could end your life and gain Malak's favor with a single stroke of my lightsaber.",
      "nm45aabast01071_.mp3": "You are brave... and some would say foolish. But you are also right. The dark side has not wholly consumed me. I cannot raise my blade against you.",
      "nm45aabast01072_.mp3": "You will go on to defeat Malak, of this I have little doubt. You will have gone from being the Sith Lord, himself, to the savior of our galaxy.",
      "nm45aabast01073_.mp3": "And... and you said you loved me. This may not be the best time to say it, but...",
      "nm45aabast01074_.mp3": "I love you, too. With all my heart.",
      "nm45aabast01076_.mp3": "After this? No, nothing could make me feel safer than to be loved by you.",
      "nm45aabast01077_.mp3": "I... I must know something, first, before that happens. I must ask you something.",
      "nm45aabast01078_.mp3": "Will there be a place for me in your future? Do you... do you love me?",
      "nm45aabast01082_.mp3": "I see. Thank you for your honesty. It's probably for the best that it goes no further. You saved me and I will always be grateful.",
      "nm45aabast01083_.mp3": "You should go. Malak awaits. This isn't over, yet... for any of us.",
      "nm45aabast01084_.mp3": "I should stay here, though. If we face Malak I am afraid his dark presence will overwhelm me. It would not be wise to expose myself to such temptation.",
      "nm45aabast01086_.mp3": "I'm sorry, but the risk is too great. I am not wholly free of the dark side's shadow. Not yet. But you are more than a match for the Dark Lord. I understand that now.",
      "nm45aabast01088_.mp3": "Yes, that would be for the best. You don't need me to defeat Malak, anyway. Now I understand that a true Jedi is a match for any Sith. Even the Dark Lord himself.",
      "nm45aabast01089_.mp3": "You are brave... and foolish. The dark side has wholly consumed me, and you will suffer for failing to see that!",
      "nm45aabast01091_.mp3": "A wise decision. You cannot trust me, and you cannot bring yourself to execute me. I see now there is only one way this can end. The time for words is done! Defend yourself!",
      "nm45aabast01092_.mp3": "[Failure] The Jedi code is nothing but words, the babblings of senile old Masters! The code cannot help me now!",
      "nm45aabast01093_.mp3": "I ask you for an honorable death, but you are too weak to even grant me that! No more words! This must end with blood!",
      "nm45aabast01097_.mp3": "You were a special case. The Council had no other choice. They needed you alive so they could discover the location of the Star Forge. It was an act of desperation.",
      "nm45aabast01098_.mp3": "It was my responsibility to watch over you, to make sure you did not slip back into your evil ways. I was supposed to protect you from the dark side.",
      "nm45aabast01100_.mp3": "But at what cost? In protecting you, I fell to the dark side myself. Is that the price of a Jedi's redemption? Must another of the Order fall to save me?",
      "nm45aabast01101_.mp3": "I cannot allow that to happen. Please, this is too painful. Strike me down. End this now, quickly. There is no other way.",
      "nm45aabast01103_.mp3": "I... I suppose you are right. Yet the path I have chosen is that of the dark side. I don't see any way I could atone for what I have done. I deserve to die.",
      "nm45aabast01105_.mp3": "It's true I possess... feelings for you. But was it only an illusion brought about by our bond? And what was the cost?",
      "nm45aabast01106_.mp3": "Please... this is too painful. End it now, quickly. There is no other way.",
      "nm45aabast01108_.mp3": "[Success] You... love me? Heh. I... there was a time I yearned for and yet dreaded to hear those words. I loved you, too, but I could never... face who you were.",
      "nm45aabast01109_.mp3": "Malak knew how I felt. Any part of the light that was within me would be extinguished when I killed you.",
      "nm45aabast01110_.mp3": "But what good is love? It cannot save me from the sea of blackness I am drowning in. I have betrayed everything I ever believed in! How can I atone for that?",
      "nm45aabast01112_.mp3": "Do it. Quickly...",
      "nm45aabast01114_.mp3": "I will stay here in this chamber and use my Battle Meditation to aid the Republic fleet. I am their only hope of destroying the Star Forge and ending the Sith menace.",
      "nm45aabast01115_.mp3": "You must go and face Malak, but you have to hurry. Once I turn the battle in the Republic's favor we won't have much time to escape the Star Forge before it is destroyed.",
      "nm45aabast01116_.mp3": "Good luck, my love... and may the Force be with you.",
      "nm45aabast01117_.mp3": "Good luck... and may the Force be with you.",
      "nm45aabast01165_.mp3": "Revan - I knew you'd come for me.",
      "nm45aabast01166_.mp3": "The Star Forge is under assault from the entire Republic fleet! If I don't use my Battle Meditation to turn the tide, Admiral Dodonna's capital ships will destroy the Star Forge.",
      "nm45aabast01167_.mp3": "I have to stay here in the command center so that I can best use my Battle Meditation against our enemy. If I don't the Star Forge will be lost!",
      "nm45aabast01168_.mp3": "You must go to face Malak without me. Find him, kill him and reclaim the title of Dark Lord of the Sith!",
      "nm45aabast06902_.mp3": "With each passing moment your old apprentice becomes stronger, Master. We must act quickly to exact your vengeance. Malak will pay for stealing the mantle of Dark Lord from you!",
      "nm45aacart02017_.mp3": "That's wonderful news!",
      "nm45aacart02020_.mp3": "I don't think anyone actually expected that he could be redeemed. I'm surprised you would even think of trying.",
      "nm45aacart02024_.mp3": "There's no time to celebrate just yet. I was able to use my Battle Meditation to allow the Republic to break through the Sith fleet. The capital ships are in bombardment range!",
      "nm45aacart02039_.mp3": "Carth. I knew I sensed your presence. I should have known you would find a way to meddle in this one last time!",
      "nm45aacart02041_.mp3": "You are a fool. Revan has already made her choice, and there is no turning back!",
      "nm45aacart02042_.mp3": "Don't listen to him, master! Let me strike him down! Seize your victory!!",
      "nm45aacart02047_.mp3": "Your words are meaningless. You have no idea of the power we now wield! Revan will rule the galaxy!!",
      "nm45aacart02057_.mp3": "No! I won't let you do this! Don't be a fool, Revan!!",
      "nm45aacart02061_.mp3": "No! No-ooo!! You can't do this! Not when we're so close!!",
      "nm45aadrkj03001_.mp3": "The only fools are those who still follow Malak. Open your eyes and see the true Lord of the Sith: Revan has returned!",
      "nm45aajedi01003_.mp3": "Excellent! The Jedi fools will provide a distraction to the Sith troops while we hunt down Malak!",
      "nm45aajedi01006_.mp3": "The Wookiee is weak; the strain of Mission's murder was too much for him. His mind has snapped!",
      "nm45aajedi01007_.mp3": "Excellent! The Jedi fools will provide a distraction to the Sith troops while we hunt down Malak!",
      "nm45aaligh01000_.mp3": "Master, why have you summoned me? Without my Battle Meditation there is a chance the Republic capital ships could break through and attack the Star Forge itself!",
      "nm45aaligh01002_.mp3": "Revan? But...",
      "nm45aaligh01005_.mp3": "Y-yes, Lord Malak.",

      "nm17afhhel01032_.mp3": "Your father loved you so. He wanted you to be just like him... he wanted to take you on his hunts, but I said they were too dangerous.",
      "nm17afhhel01034_.mp3": "I always tried to keep him from the dangerous ones, but he would have none of it. It was a reckless life we led, always moving... I didn't want that for you.",
      "nm17afhhel01038_.mp3": "What do your father and I have to show for all those years of hunting? Nothing. That was no life for anyone, especially not someone as gifted as you.",
      "nm17afhhel01040_.mp3": "Your father... he spent all his last years trying to pay for my treatments. That's why he went for the pearls. I begged him not to, but...",
      "nm17afhhel01042_.mp3": "Your treatments.",
      "nm17afhhel01044_.mp3": "I'm dying, Bastila. I did not lie about that. It's been a long time in the coming, and there's really nothing that can be done anymore.",

      "nm17afhhel01054_.mp3": "Well, now. You said you had important business, and you were never one to mince words. You there... you take care of my daughter, you hear me?",
      "nm17afhhel01056_.mp3": "That's good. I'll feel a lot better knowing there's someone to watch her.",
      "nm17afhhel01060_.mp3": "*sigh* Alright, I will. Now you do what you have to, Bastila. You go make your father and I proud.",
      "nm17afhhel01065_.mp3": "So could her father. That doesn't mean she doesn't need help now and again.",
      "nm17afhhel01068_.mp3": "You make her let you. She's too much like her father in that respect.",
      "nm17afhhel01071_.mp3": "So you're not. I'd feel better knowing that someone was there to watch over her, however. I wasn't.",
      "nm17afhhel01079_.mp3": "So that's the way it is, is it? All that Jedi training and you haven't learned a thing.",
      "nm17afhhel01083_.mp3": "How can you learn anything when you hear only what you want to hear? Well, go on, then. Keep the holocron. It was for you, anyhow.",
      "nm17afhhel01085_.mp3": "I'll just go off and die peacefully and you needn't bother with me anymore. That's obviously what's best.",
      "nm17afhhel01089_.mp3": "Hmph. It may as well be with one of us.",
      "nm17afhhel01093_.mp3": "Then what are you waiting for? Go, find it!",

      "nm17afhhel01097_.mp3": "You know my daughter? Where is she?",
      "nm17afhhel01099_.mp3": "Is that so? Has she said this, herself? Tell her it is quite urgent that I speak with her at once. She has been most difficult to find.",
      "nm17afhhel01101_.mp3": "I most certainly will not. What I have to say is for Bastila alone. It is... family business. That should be enough for her to come.",
      "nm17afhhel01104_.mp3": "I don't see why Bastila should be telling anything to a stranger about family business. Simply tell her to come and that should be enough.",
      "nm17afhhel01107_.mp3": "See that you do. If Bastila is here, I can't see why she didn't come herself.",
      "nm17afhhel01110_.mp3": "I'm sure there are plenty of other strangers about for you to harass with questions. Why don't you select one of them?",
      "nm17afhhel01112_.mp3": "Thank you. I would rather be alone.",
      "nm17afhhel01115_.mp3": "Good. I thought you were perhaps one of those collectors from the Exchange. Since you're not, I doubt we have any business. Good day. ",

      "nm17afhhel01129_.mp3": "Your Father is dead, Bastila. That is part of the reason why I was looking for you.",
      "nm17afhhel01133_.mp3": "Isn't this a lovely reunion? Already she is flinging insults at me. Tell me... you're one of her friends. Do you treat your mother this way?",

      "nm17afhhel01139_.mp3": "Such sweet things you say. *sigh* Perhaps I should tell you everything, first, before we start arguing again.",
      "nm17afhhel01143_.mp3": "I hadn't realized Jedi were so spiteful. You want me to tell you I brought your father here for an expedition, do you? You want to blame me for his death?",
      "nm17afhhel01145_.mp3": "You never accepted that your father loved going on his treasure hunts, leaving you alone with me. I was always to blame for everything, what else is new?",
      "nm17afhhel01147_.mp3": "So yes, fine. I brought your father here to look for krayt dragon pearls. He took an expedition into the Tatooine desert and he died.",
      "nm17afhhel01151_.mp3": "Do you think I would look for you if I wasn't sure? They were attacked by a krayt dragon and one of the guides fled the battle. He saw your father killed.",
      "nm17afhhel01155_.mp3": "Don't be insulting. I want you to use those senses of yours. I want you to find him. I want you to bring back his holocron.",
      "nm17afhhel01159_.mp3": "Is it too much to ask that I have something to remember your father by? Of course it is, isn't it? You couldn't be bothered.",
      "nm17afhhel01163_.mp3": "As my daughter is quick to point out, I haven't the coin to hire another expedition. Nor am I the adventurer my husband was.",
      "nm17afhhel01175_.mp3": "I believe your father was headed north towards the Sand People enclave. I would check along that route, dear. Do please hurry.",
      "nm17afhhel01178_.mp3": "I'm sure Bastila feels the same way you do. She would prefer to be left out of it, at least until I'm as dead as her father is.",
      "nm17afhhel01181_.mp3": "I see Bastila seeks out friends that are as selfish as she is. This is how you treat a dying woman?",

      "nglobebant00094_.mp3": "Well, I've managed to avoid it the last 20 years or so. Besides, light side, dark side: they don't mean the same to me as they do to you. I don't see in absolutes.",
      "nglobebant00097_.mp3": "I want to stop Malak as much as anyone. But I don't have to join the Order to do it. Look at Carth, or Canderous. They're with us in this quest, but they aren't Jedi.",
      "nglobebant00098_.mp3": "The capacity for good or evil, like the Force itself, is in all living creatures. And belonging to the Jedi Order, or the Sith, or any group, won't change what you are at your core.",
      "nglobebant00100_.mp3": "Yeah, I'm old and stubborn. But I appreciate the effort. But from now on you can just think of me as any other non-Jedi in our little group - with a lightsaber. And Force powers.",
      "nglobebant00103_.mp3": "Yeah, that's right, sonny. The Sith are the greatest evil to hit the galaxy since, well, the Mandalorians. And they're the worst thing since Exar Kun. Blah, blah, blah, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.",
      "nglobebant00105_.mp3": "Look, everybody always figures the time they live in is the most epic, most important age to end all ages. But tyrants and heroes rise and fall, and historians sort out the pieces.",
      "nglobebant00107_.mp3": "Malak is a tyrant who should be stopped. If he conquers the galaxy we're in for a couple of rough centuries. Eventually it'll come around again, but I'd rather not wait that long.",
      "nglobebant00108_.mp3": "So we do what we have to do, and we try to stop the Sith. But don't start thinking this war - your war - is more important than any other war just because you're in it.",
      "nglobebant00110_.mp3": "You believe whatever you need to to get you through this, sonny. The bottom line is we both want to stop Malak, so let's not get hung up on the details. Let's just get back to stopping him.",
      "nglobedavi05002_.mp3": "Well, I'll be a Wookiee's uncle. Davin! Davin Kotras!",
      "nglobedavi05010_.mp3": "You're too kind. Not the young lad anymore yourself, I see.",
      "nglobedavi05012_.mp3": "Yes, yes, right you are. Sorry, Davin, but duty calls. Maybe I'll run into you again soon.",
      "nglobedavi05016_.mp3": "What, are you deaf? His name's Davin. Old friend from my wanderer days. By the by, Davin, I really should be running off...",
      "nglobedavi05020_.mp3": "No. Why? What's there to hear?",
      "nglobedavi05026_.mp3": "That's preposterous.",
      "nglobedavi05030_.mp3": "Perhaps I will at that. It's up to my old friend, here, actually. I'm just tagging along.",
      "nglobedavi05032_.mp3": "I'd appreciate that. Sunry's an old friend... I'd hate to see him hurt.",
      "nglobedavi05036_.mp3": "I will. Be safe, old friend.",
      "nglobedavi05039_.mp3": "I was expecting that. Still... if we get the chance, I'd be grateful. Sunry's an old friend... I'd hate to see him hurt.",
      "nglobedavi05042_.mp3": "Perhaps I will at that. It's up to my friend, here, actually. I'm just tagging along.",
      "nglobejole09742_.mp3": "Nope. Never was. Technically I never rose above the rank of Padawan, for various reasons. Does that surprise you?",
      "nglobejole09744_.mp3": "Heh. I suppose I'm not prone to live my life like most of the Jedi Masters do, that's true. My opinions on love are no different.",
      "nglobejole09746_.mp3": "In my case, becoming a Jedi would have been a formality. I doubt the order and I would have gotten along well, considering my opinions on things such as love.",
      "nglobejole09748_.mp3": "No I didn't. I may never have become a Jedi technically, but I'm an old Padawan with a lifetime of experience. That applies both to the Force as well as topics like love.",
      "nglobejole09749_.mp3": "I was an experienced Padawan, surely... but not yet ready to be a full Jedi and certainly not ready to train another. Especially not one so old as my wife.",
      "nglobejole09750_.mp3": "Not to mention that I had remained a Padawan throughout the war. A formality, perhaps, but with the trial it had to be decided if I was worthy to become a Jedi at all.",
      "nglobejole09751_.mp3": "They said I had learned wisdom the hard way. For all I had done during the war, they wished to raise me to full Jedi status at long last.",
      "nglobejole09758_.mp3": "*whisper* The Jedi Council wouldn't approve, but they always were a little stodgy about using the Force on people. Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.[R1]",
      "nglobejole09759_.mp3": "I know I'm just an old codger, but in my time I've learned what goes around comes around. These things have a way of coming back to you in the end.",
      "nglobejole09760_.mp3": "*whisper* Heh! Reminds me of my old smuggling days. Nothing better than the old Jedi mind trick for getting past an overly curious customs officer.",
      "nglobejole09762_.mp3": "Nice. Real nice. Maybe later we could find some insects to pull the legs off, huh?",
      "nglobejole09763_.mp3": "Hey, kid, that was a good thing you did there. Almost brought a tear to this old man's eye.",
      "nm03aecalo05031_.mp3": "It's four against one, Calo. What do you think about those odds? Well? You have something more to say?",
      "nm12aastar03001_.mp3": "I can feel the power of the dark side emanating from that space station. It almost feels like... like it's alive. That must be where Malak has taken Bastila.",
      "nm12aastar03005_.mp3": "What was that? What's wrong? Did one of the Sith fighters hit us?",
      "nm17aa03sh01033_.mp3": "*sigh* And how many more like you are there out there, with no one to buy their plates, I wonder?",
      "nm17aa03sh01065_.mp3": "My, my. You should be proud of yourself, outwitting her like that.",
      "nm17aa03sh01159_.mp3": "You've got a real mean streak, kid. You might want to work on that; nasty people tend to come to nasty ends.",
      "nm17aa11iz05082_.mp3": "I'm thinking they're with the Sand People, who live in the south. Either that or I need my ears cleaned.",
      "nm17aa11iz05124_.mp3": "That seems pretty convenient, but it won't hurt to look. We *are* going to look, right?",
      "nm17aaiziz99151_.mp3": "Oh, I get it. He's small and helpless so we can just do whatever we want, right? Sometimes I just don't know about you, kid.",
      "nm17ac08yu02074_.mp3": "You know, I may have been out of circulation for a while, but doesn't it seem likely to you that this friend of yours didn't own the droid?",
      "nm17ad03gu03038_.mp3": "Ugh. Must we stand so close to them? I'd forgotten what Gamorreans smelled like.",
      "nm17ad03ta06006_.mp3": "[Force Persuade] Just answer the lady's questions.",
      "nm17ad03ta06009_.mp3": "I thought it obvious. Should he act like that after mentioning his wife? Greasy little wrench-rat. He asked for it.",
      "nm17ad03ta06011_.mp3": "I have no doubt. I just don't like him. Mentions his wife and then acts like that.",
      "nm17ad03ta06013_.mp3": "I only meant to help him clear his thoughts. He's confused if he'll mention a wife and then act like that... the greasy little scavenger.",
      "nm17ad03ta06041_.mp3": "Hmph. Hunting a species to extinction. Now there's a logical way to make a living.",
      "nm17ae04ce02029_.mp3": "And you're surprised that the boy doesn't want to sign?",
      "nm17ae04ce02057_.mp3": "*ahem* Do as we say, scoundrel! You don't want to anger a shortempered Jedi!",
      "nm17ae04ce02086_.mp3": "*ahem* Do as we say, scoundrel! You don't want to anger a shortempered Jedi!",
      "nm17ae04ce02105_.mp3": "I bet you just can't understand why they wouldn't trust someone who's only in it for the money, too.",
      "nm17ae04ce02107_.mp3": "You know, for a brute you say the sweetest things.",
      "nm17af07ja05016_.mp3": "Seems fairly clear to me, though he doesn't seem used to people actually stopping to listen.",
      "nm17ag10cz01172_.mp3": "*whisper* Nicely done, kid. Those extra credits could come in handy on our little search. Besides, it's not like Czerka Corp. can't afford it.",
      "nm18ab10ta05011_.mp3": "Philandering ways coming back to haunt him, I'll wager.",
      "nm18ab10ta05024_.mp3": "Maybe we could program them to tap-dance? I love a good tap-dance.",
      "nm18ackoma99136_.mp3": "You keep turning on people like this, kid, and one day you just might find yourself without any help when you really need it.",
      "nm18acstar99005_.mp3": "The Star Map is an artifact of the dark side. The krayt dragon may have been drawn here by its dark power, only to be enslaved by it.",
      "nm18acstar99006_.mp3": "Well, no point hanging around here. Now that we've got the Star Map we might as well move on.",
      "nm18acstar99012_.mp3": "Finding this Star Map here in this cave gives me a cold shiver. You don't think it's just coincidence that the krayt dragon made its home here, do you?",
      "nm22aajano06056_.mp3": "[Force Persuade] Hmph. 'Harvesting'. Tell us about this agreement with the Wookiee leadership.",
      "nm22abchor02021_.mp3": "Hmph! I merely have an appreciation for solitude.",
      "nm22abgorw08024_.mp3": "That would be me. Jolee Bindo. Do I really look so different up close?",
      "nm23aawook01025_.mp3": "Madam, I am not a fool. I survive because I am careful.",
      "nm23aawook01111_.mp3": "Well, a gifted few, perhaps.",
      "nm23abjaar01031_.mp3": "*sigh* This will end in sadness. Don't say I didn't warn you.",
      "nm23abwoor02011_.mp3": "We're rather hairless, aren't we?",
      "nm23acworr01034_.mp3": "There was pain no matter how this ended. Perhaps this is for the best.",
      "nm23acworr01054_.mp3": "A painful end, but perhaps it is the right thing to do. We shall see.",
      "nm23acworr01076_.mp3": "I urge you caution. This may seem like the right path to follow... but you do not know these people as I do.",
      "nm23acworr01142_.mp3": "Greed will lead you down the dark side if you are not careful. You must not seek material gain at the expense of the ideals the Jedi hold dear.",
      "nm23adchuu01041_.mp3": "Oh, yes. Far better to have both the blade and a possible rival as far from Kashyyyk as possible, hey? *sigh* I feel very tired of this place, now.",
      "nm23adchuu01045_.mp3": "Right you are. I think I'll do just that.",
      "nm23adchuu01092_.mp3": "Oh, you're wrong on that count, actually. Not that I would expect you to know that.",
      "nm23adchuu01103_.mp3": "Bah! Save your threats, I'm sick of the forest. And I'm not too fond of what happened here. I'll take the ride. ",
      "nm23adchuu01137_.mp3": "*That* is your advice? Side with the slaver? Fine, fine... it's your call.",
      "nm23adchuu01168_.mp3": "Wait... isn't that my line?",
      "nm23adfrey02033_.mp3": "Now, you just close your hole, child. It's a shock, I'm sure, but this isn't about you.",
      "nm23adfrey02062_.mp3": "Oh, this isn't wise. An angry Wookiee can't be reasoned with.",
      "nm23adfrey02081_.mp3": "Oh, I don't think that will work this time.",
      "nm24aaforc01001_.mp3": "Here we are again. Shall I bypass the field so we may pass?",
      "nm24aaforc01003_.mp3": "There, you see? Beautifully subtle, isn't it? At least, compared to other Czerka equipment dumped down here.",
      "nm24aaforc01004_.mp3": "It's only been here a short while, or the Wookiees would have disabled it. They wouldn't have had an easy time of it, though.",
      "nm24aaforc01006_.mp3": "I think it was an attempt to block the more dangerous carnivores from wandering freely, but it's not very effective.",
      "nm24aaforc01007_.mp3": "It limits us non-climbers, but the creatures of Kashyyyk are very adaptable. You'll see why when we reach your goal.",
      "nm24aaforc01009_.mp3": "Yes, but I don't make a habit of it. The other side is genuinely dangerous.",
      "nm24aaforc01011_.mp3": "I can manipulate it for a moment. Let me see... how did the Czerka engineers do it...",
      "nm24aaforc01013_.mp3": "There are others, each blocking similar points on certain paths. It is all very calculated. Very precise.",
      "nm24aaforc01014_.mp3": "It would have been effective if it hadn't relied on the creatures to be walking. Climbers don't have much trouble getting around it.",
      "nm24aaforc01016_.mp3": "You aren't going to ask about it? A repulsor field in the woods and you have no interest?",
      "nm24aaforc01019_.mp3": "All right then, uh, how did it go...",
      "nm24aaforc01020_.mp3": "Ah, very well. Young durga-spits like you have no appreciation for details. Now, let's see... how did I do it...",
      "nm24aaforc01021_.mp3": "Ahh, there we go. Now keep moving. These are the most dangerous depths of Kashyyyk. ",
      "nm24aaforc01022_.mp3": "A few surprises wait for us, I'll wager. ",
      "nm24aajole05000_.mp3": "Ah, the damnable racket of battle! Watch yourself, even more of these crawling beasts are hiding in the underbrush.",
      "nm24aajole05002_.mp3": "Quit your yapping for now. We'll talk when the company is better. Get to fightin'!",
      "nm24aajole05006_.mp3": "Well, that was acceptable. You're not quite the commander I'd have accompanied in my youth, but you managed to walk away.",
      "nm24aajole05008_.mp3": "I'm Jolee. Jolee Bindo. Follow me to my camp and we'll talk a bit.",
      "nm24aajole05010_.mp3": "Why am I here? Hmph. Well it isn't because I like the stink of dead kinrath. Let's move this talk to my camp where the air is better.",
      "nm24aajole05012_.mp3": "Keep close. It's nearby, under a log. Yeah, I live like some burrowing rodent. I fought the Sith... now look at me. Hmph!",
      "nm24aajole05015_.mp3": "Ah, don't start fawning just yet, I'm too old for it. *Sigh* I...I know a few things, but we can talk about it at my camp.",
      "nm24aajole05018_.mp3": "Look, you can follow now or stumble around on your own, but I'm too old to care whether you think I'm babysitting you.",
      "nm24aajole05020_.mp3": "That's the way! Now prove that wasn't blind luck, you baby!",
      "nm24aajole06000_.mp3": "Well, welcome to my home, such as it is. Pull up a stump and be comfortable. We should discuss a few things.",
      "nm24aajole06002_.mp3": "Don't coddle me, child. I'm neither a Jedi nor your master. I'm just an old man that's been lost in the woods for far too long.",
      "nm24aajole06003_.mp3": "My days of glory are behind me, but... perhaps there is something I can do for you. You must have questions.",
      "nm24aajole06005_.mp3": "Look, we've been through this before. My past is my affair. Get some years behind you and then we'll talk about me.",
      "nm24aajole06006_.mp3": "I think you'll agree that we have more important things to discuss, no?",
      "nm24aajole06007_.mp3": "Ah, what is there to tell? Jolee Bindo is the crazy old man in the dangerous woods. I'm content with the impression I give.",
      "nm24aajole06009_.mp3": "I follow the Jedi Way and I command the Force, yes, and I suppose that makes me as much a Jedi as anyone... but what of it?",
      "nm24aajole06010_.mp3": "I've seen my share of the dark and the light. And frankly, both extremes annoy me. Of course... I have felt the rumblings of change...",
      "nm24aajole06011_.mp3": "Perhaps you will be of some assistance to me after all. Let us discuss what you came here for.",
      "nm24aajole06013_.mp3": "Ah, and it makes you think I may have the taint of the dark side in me, doesn't it? Ooh. Is that what you are wondering, huh? Ooh.",
      "nm24aajole06014_.mp3": "Well, I assure you, I see more grey than dark or light. I'm just a stubborn old man, tired of the foolishness of others.",
      "nm24aajole06016_.mp3": "Wait wait wait, slow down. I have to ask something of you. I've got something you need, and you can help me.",
      "nm24aajole06017_.mp3": "We both know why you have come here. The Star Map. That has to be it. There is nothing else here.",
      "nm24aajole06018_.mp3": "The problems of a few Wookiees don't amount to anything before the concerns of the Jedi. No, you are here for the map.",
      "nm24aajole06020_.mp3": "Kashyyyk is an interesting place, more so than anyone suspects. If Czerka Corporation knew, heh, the planet would be a strip mine.",
      "nm24aajole06021_.mp3": "The Wookiees have their legends that they were not always here, but it is more than that. The trees themselves are strangers.",
      "nm24aajole06023_.mp3": "What I'm saying is that there are literally walls in your way, and you won't find what you need without my help... and my help has a price.",
      "nm24aajole06024_.mp3": "Of course, this won't be a problem for you, since you have already completed my task. Removal of the Czerka poachers.",
      "nm24aajole06025_.mp3": "Now, I'm not sure if you'll measure up to my task, seeing as how you've already joined up with the slime I want gone.",
      "nm24aajole06027_.mp3": "The Czerka poachers, I can smell that scent they use on you. I don't care what you told them, I want them gone.",
      "nm24aajole06028_.mp3": "After you do that, I want to join up with you. Then I'll remove the barrier between you and the lower Shadowlands.",
      "nm24aajole06030_.mp3": "Hunting monkey is part of your great plan? I know you talked to the Czerka poachers, and I don't care. I want them gone.",
      "nm24aajole06031_.mp3": "You must do a task for me, and then allow me to join with you. I will then remove certain barriers in your path.",
      "nm24aajole06033_.mp3": "Oh, save it. I know this sounds absurd, but I'm old and entitled to work you around a bit. Besides, the test is simple.",
      "nm24aajole06037_.mp3": "Since they began expanding in the Shadowlands, the Czerka have left me alone, for the most part. Until recently, anyway. ",
      "nm24aajole06038_.mp3": "A group of them set up camp not far from here. Poachers is all they are. I'd like them removed from this place.",
      "nm24aajole06040_.mp3": "They don't respect this place. They are butchering wildlife and threatening entire species. It's getting under my skin. ",
      "nm24aajole06041_.mp3": "The Wookiees could take care of themselves if they wished, but the animals are truly helpless victims.",
      "nm24aajole06043_.mp3": "Oh please, this is arbitrary errand work, but such are the requests of the aged. You still have to do it.",
      "nm24aajole06044_.mp3": "Their camp is in the far northeast. Now remember, if I wanted them dead, I'd have done it myself. Find a better way.",
      "nm24aajole06046_.mp3": "Good. Return to me here and we will see how you have done. Shoo. Shoo!",
      "nm24aajole06048_.mp3": "Yes, yes, I'm an old man that's getting fussy. Call me foolish if you will, I don't care. You still have to do it.",
      "nm24aajole06049_.mp3": "I told you, they are destroying the environment. People are mostly annoying, but the balance of nature, *that* needs protecting.",
      "nm24aajole06051_.mp3": "They are not that far northeast of here. There is usually five in the area, as far as I can see.",
      "nm24aajole06052_.mp3": "The Captain of the lot is the one that earned my ire. Mishandle my garden, will he? Hmph!",
      "nm24aajole06054_.mp3": "You presumably have a ship. I've seen all I wish to here. Isn't that enough? I mean, I'm really sick of the trees.",
      "nm24aajole06055_.mp3": "And perhaps your destiny might show me something new. You never know.",
      "nm24aajole06057_.mp3": "Don't talk back to your elders, child. Look, they know me quite well, and are always on alert when I approach.",
      "nm24aajole06058_.mp3": "The only way I could get rid of them would be violence, which would eventually lead to trouble for the Wookiees.",
      "nm24aajole06059_.mp3": "I want them gone, but with as little fuss as possible. They have already caused enough trouble as it is.",
      "nm24aajole06064_.mp3": "Did I? You have annoyingly good ears. It doesn't matter. Those days are gone. Leave them in their graves.",
      "nm24aajole06066_.mp3": "Why, don't you like what I've done with the place? The creatures here aren't any more treacherous than elsewhere.",
      "nm24aajole06068_.mp3": "Yes, among the Wookiees. Intriguing creatures. I like that they have little patience for bureaucrats.",
      "nm24aajole06069_.mp3": "But of course, even here there are hidden things that manipulate.",
      "nm24aajole06071_.mp3": "Czerka Corporation was smart to put him in power. He's as good at destroying Wookiee culture as dropping corpses full of Ardroxian Flu.",
      "nm24aajole06072_.mp3": "Will you work for him or against him, I wonder? I will be interested to see.",
      "nm24aajole06074_.mp3": "Uh, sure, how's this: think for yourself. I don't care for politics, and I'm big on letting people figure things out for themselves.",
      "nm24aajole06075_.mp3": "The Wookiees have prophesies of deliverance if you ask them, but for now they follow without hesitation. That is their wish.",
      "nm24aajole06077_.mp3": "Maddened with grief, perhaps, but not crazed. I helped him pass to the lower forests where only a Wookiee could follow.",
      "nm24aajole06078_.mp3": "Some other matters will determine if you can follow. There is a barrier that... well, we'll talk of that more in a moment.",
      "nm24aajole06080_.mp3": "It is a very unfortunate matter. It will end in shame and sorrow. You will find Rorworr down here. And more.",
      "nm24aajole06081_.mp3": "I have witnessed a number of happenings, but I have left them for others to sort out. ",
      "nm24aajole06083_.mp3": "I wasn't aware I had to be. Look, events like these reveal much about the people involved. I'm well past that introspective tripe.",
      "nm24aajole06084_.mp3": "I'm not saying that outside help isn't needed. I just... well... ",
      "nm24aajole06085_.mp3": "I didn't want to make anyone mad while I didn't have a way off the planet. We'll talk more about that momentarily.",
      "nm24aajole06087_.mp3": "On the body of Rorworr, I know. His death will not go unnoticed. I have been wondering how this foolishness would play out.",
      "nm24aajole06088_.mp3": "I am no weaponsmith, but someone in the village will be able to identify the owner of that bolt casing. They are very personal items.",
      "nm24aajole06090_.mp3": "*Sigh* Fine, fine, just be brief.",
      "nm24aajole06092_.mp3": "I smell their tach-scent on you. Did you agree to hunt for them? Let me remind you that I do not approve, and you need me.",
      "nm24aajole06093_.mp3": "Go to their camp and get rid of them. When you are through, we can proceed to the lower Shadowlands. Not before.",
      "nm24aajole06094_.mp3": "They are not hard to find. Their camp is to the far northeast. Try to get them to leave without too much fuss.",
      "nm24aajole06095_.mp3": "After you finish, I will make it so you can pass the barrier that prevents your access to the lower Shadowlands.",
      "nm24aajole06097_.mp3": "Now why would you be asking about that, hmm? Don't answer. I knew that had to be why you were here.",
      "nm24aajole06098_.mp3": "I told you my price. After you complete my task I'll make it so you can pass the barriers blocking your goal. That's all I will add on the subject.",
      "nm24aajole06100_.mp3": "Ahh, I thought you would spot that. It's easy to see with Force-sensitive eyes, isn't it? Heh heh. Czerka put it there.",
      "nm24aajole06101_.mp3": "It's a troublesome thing, blocking some access to the lower Shadowlands. That's where you want to go, isn't it?",
      "nm24aajole06102_.mp3": "As I said, if you complete my task and allow me to join your group, I will remove the repulsor field from your path.",
      "nm24aajole06103_.mp3": "I saw them put it in, so only I know how to manipulate it. That knowledge will serve me now. Do as I ask.",
      "nm24aajole06105_.mp3": "You'll have nothing but time if you don't take what help you can. I've been here for many years. I know things. Remember that.",
      "nm24aajole06107_.mp3": "I'm sure you are, but you have to take time to listen. Really, you shouldn't try so hard to make new enemies.",
      "nm24aajole06109_.mp3": "Do you? Well, I'd better not keep you. I mean, I've only spent about twenty years here. Heh. What could I possibly tell you?",
      "nm24aajole06110_.mp3": "Hmph! You don't want to be just another fool with a big impatient chip on their shoulder. That's a dark road, child.",
      "nm24aajole06113_.mp3": "Yes, yes. I suppose it's my lot in life, to spend years learning something so that someone else can be impatient to hear it.",
      "nm24aajole06115_.mp3": "Oh ho, your manner is fearsome. Like the little ullers I shoo from the garden, hissing at what they don't understand. ",
      "nm24aajole06116_.mp3": "I'm too old for your posturing, child. If you have questions, then ask them.",
      "nm24aajole06117_.mp3": "Welcome back. I wonder, have you had much luck? Have you done as I asked?",
      "nm24aajole06119_.mp3": "Yes, I heard the fuss of it. I told you I wanted a non-violent solution, and I had my reasons for it. You should have thought about that.",
      "nm24aajole06120_.mp3": "Czerka Corporation will find the bodies and blame the Wookiees. This may cause more troops to be deployed. That means more disruption.",
      "nm24aajole06121_.mp3": "I'm not pleased, but what's done is done and I'm not here to judge you. Hopefully you'll take care of that yourself.",
      "nm24aajole06123_.mp3": "Well, perhaps I have a duty to point out what you should have learned from this. Or perhaps... no.",
      "nm24aajole06125_.mp3": "I see. You are completely detached. Are you sure you're not a droid? It doesn't matter. A trivial thing like this is no measure of anyone.",
      "nm24aajole06127_.mp3": "Oh, go bark up a tree. You'll get the same response out of me. Besides, I'm not about to get in the habit of grading you.",
      "nm24aajole06129_.mp3": "You're pretty much right, really. Truth be known, I won't judge how you fared... as long as you can LIVE WITH YOURSELF!",
      "nm24aajole06130_.mp3": "Was that convincing? It's been a while since I've been in the company of someone that needed that kind of babysitting.",
      "nm24aajole06132_.mp3": "A good teacher, and I'm not saying I am one, but a good teacher doesn't mash a book in a student's face shouting \"learn this bit here!\"",
      "nm24aajole06133_.mp3": "If you can't look at the situation for yourself and see the logic behind my way of doing things, you're not the type to understand me anyway.",
      "nm24aajole06134_.mp3": "Besides, you're a little old for that master/student fuss, aren't you? I know I am.",
      "nm24aajole06136_.mp3": "You were here and it needed doing. Besides, dealing with the Czerka is dirty business. I hope you washed your hands.",
      "nm24aajole06138_.mp3": "Yes, yes, in the east past the poacher camp. I saw it when it was installed. It's a very effective barrier, but I know how to get past it.",
      "nm24aajole06140_.mp3": "Yes, of course. Let's get moving. I noticed the old paths some time ago. You probably wouldn't have found them on your own.",
      "nm24aajole06141_.mp3": "There's also a Czerka repulsor field blocking the way, past the poacher camp in the east. I saw it when it was installed, so I know how to pass it.",
      "nm24aajole06142_.mp3": "And on the other side... ancient answers. And perhaps a Wookiee you were seeking. I hope he's in the mood for visitors.",
      "nm24aajole06144_.mp3": "I know where you want to go. I can get you through to the old paths. This forest hides some strange things.",
      "nm24aajole06145_.mp3": "Yes, I could feel it as you walked near. And I don't sense the smell of death on you. You spared them? Interesting.",
      "nm24aajole06147_.mp3": "Wasn't there? I suppose not, but the environment would say otherwise, if it could talk. No matter.",
      "nm24aajole06149_.mp3": "If you imagined a meaning behind it, I suppose that's good, but I don't think such a trivial thing is any real measure of a person.",
      "nm24aajole06152_.mp3": "Well hurry up! You don't want to be stuck here as long as I have.",
      "nm24aajole06202_.mp3": "Why should being what I am compel me to entertain others with tales of the 'good old days' huh?",
      "nm24aapgen07034_.mp3": "What of it?",
      "nm24aapoff08061_.mp3": "Just you try it.",
      "nm24aapoff08074_.mp3": "That's it! You are dead!",
      "nm25aabike01006_.mp3": "More than a threat enough for you!",
      "nm25aacomp01009_.mp3": "Yes, there's the thing. Obstinate machine. I've no doubt it holds what you seek, but good luck getting it operational.",
      "nm25aacomp01011_.mp3": "Match found...? What the... it always muttered something about \"rejected patterns\" for me.",
      "nm25aacomp01039_.mp3": "Well, that is surprising. I doubt any Wookiee would support such a claim. The forest is millenia old.",
      "nm25aacomp01058_.mp3": "Hmm, five years ago? I didn't notice it. This must have been installed in strictest secrecy. It couldn't have been Czerka.",
      "nm25aacomp01062_.mp3": "Heh... call me stubborn, I guess. Heh. There wasn't much else to do around here.",
      "nm25aacomp01174_.mp3": "This machine certainly seems to want a very specific type of response.",
      "nm25aafrey02002_.mp3": "He is almost feral after all this time. Calm yourself, Freyyr. We are friends. Don't you remember me?",
      "nm25aafrey02006_.mp3": "Well, this may prove difficult.",
      "nm25aafrey02040_.mp3": "That's when I first saw him. I helped his pursuers lose him for a moment. Do you remember me now, Freyyr?",
      "nm25aafrey02085_.mp3": "I don't approve of this! Is Chuundar to be blindly obeyed?",
      "nm25aafrey02087_.mp3": "Perhaps not. Do what you will. I'm just wondering if Chuundar is the wiser choice of ally.",
      "nm25aafrey02105_.mp3": "Did we come this far only to kill this old wook? I don't approve of this at all.",
      "nm25aafrey02107_.mp3": "I know he did, but not without reason. The only outsiders he's seen for years have been slavers.",
      "nm25aafrey02111_.mp3": "Hold your tongue, child. I'm not challenging you. I just thought you'd have the smarts to consider every option. ",
      "nm25aafrey02156_.mp3": "I don't support this action! Think on this, child!",
      "nm25aafrey02158_.mp3": "Look, I'm not your nanny-droid, but I just don't think following Chuundar is the best course.",
      "nm25aafrey02169_.mp3": "Is that it? You spared his life initially just to cut him off before he can fully explain himself?",
      "nm25aastar99012_.mp3": "Well, well. A Star Map. An ancient artifact of dark side power. Can't say I'm surprised. I always knew there was something funny down here.",
      "nm25aastar99026_.mp3": "I wonder if the Star Map has had an effect on the evolution of the creatures here in the Shadowlands. Might explain why it's so dangerous down here.",
      "nm25aastar99027_.mp3": "An interesting theory, but I suppose we don't have time to test it now, do we? Now that we've got what you came for we should be heading back up to the treetops.",
      "nm26aaelor04010_.mp3": "Elora? Of all the people... How did you even know I'd left Kashyyyk?",
      "nm26aaelor04012_.mp3": "Why? Whatever could be the matter, my dear?",
      "nm26aaelor04014_.mp3": "Murder? But how...",
      "nm26aaelor04016_.mp3": "Calm down, Elora. Where's Sunry now?",
      "nm26aaelor04020_.mp3": "That's true... I'd forgotten about that. Let's not forget that he would have had to have been considerably older than the Sith woman.",
      "nm26aaelor04022_.mp3": "Hmph. I'm a Jedi... and one who was living alone in the Shadowlands until recently. That keeps you in shape, damn it! We're talking about Sunry, here.",
      "nm26aaelor04048_.mp3": "Don't worry, Elora. We'll get to the bottom of this and help Sunry... somehow.",
      "nm26aairim06064_.mp3": "Sounds like the Sith are trying to win this planet by corrupting the Selkath youth. Much more subtle than their usual methods.",
      "nm26aanilk09070_.mp3": "Hmmm. You think the Republic is trying to steal the kolto, perhaps? An odd thing for the Republic to do, no?",
      "nm26aanilk09117_.mp3": "Be careful here, kid. Start poking your nose in places it doesn't belong and you might not like what you find.",
      "nm26aapris10000_.mp3": "*growl* *snarl* When I get out of here, you're dead! I'll gut your fishy little corpse, cut off your head and bathe in your blood!",
      "nm26aaselj17024_.mp3": "Hmmm. Simply because it was real does not mean Sunry would have overlooked it being in Elassa's hand.",
      "nm26aaselj17060_.mp3": "I suppose you're Sunry's only hope. We have to at least try to help him.",
      "nm26aaselj17078_.mp3": "Yes... but it almost seems too heavily stacked, doesn't it? Very suspicious.",
      "nm26aaselj21028_.mp3": "So nice to meet an impartial judge, for a change.",
      "nm26aaselj21032_.mp3": "You said it, not I.",
      "nm26aasunr26001_.mp3": "Elora sent me, Sunry. I'm here to get you out of this mess. The courts went and made us Arbiters for your case.",
      "nm26aasunr26003_.mp3": "You saved my wrinkled butt more than a few times as well, friend, if I recall. But there'll be time for catching up later. Right now we need to focus on the case.",
      "nm26aasunr26057_.mp3": "That's different, Sunry, and you know it. We don't kill them in cold blood while they sleep.",
      "nm26aasunr26066_.mp3": "Sunry... this is wrong, and you know it. I am a Jedi... what is it that you expect me to do to defend your actions?",
      "nm26aasunr26080_.mp3": "But Sunry is a murderer. I'm sorry, old friend, but you are. I... I can't approve of this. You go ahead, however, if that's what you think is best.",
      "nm26aasunr26098_.mp3": "Soon, old friend. But we don't want to go to trial until we've got the whole picture.",
      "nm26aatria27456_.mp3": "I... I'm sorry, Sunry. And Elora. There is nothing more we can do.",
      "nm26aatria27480_.mp3": "The Republic will attempt to have him freed, Elora, I am sure. This... this is the best we could do. I'm sorry.",
      "nm26aatria27500_.mp3": "We have done all we could for you, old friend.",
      "nm26aatria27504_.mp3": "Don't thank me, thank your Arbiter. I was glad to help.",
      "nm26ab07of07012_.mp3": "The Gamorrean? You're joking.",
      "nm26acignu04079_.mp3": "Hmm... I guess this is what they call working the system. Not that I'm objecting. I just hope the Selkath don't find out about it.",
      "nm27aashas06045_.mp3": "Oh-ho! Is this how you win an argument? I would have thought it easier to prove the evil of the dark side than that.",
      "nm27aashas06082_.mp3": "Just be careful with those gifts you've already learned. Beware the dark side... or you may end up betraying your world regardless.",
      "nm27aashas06107_.mp3": "*whisper* I'm not sure what kind of game you're playing, kid, but I don't understand it. Why you would help spread Sith propaganda like this is beyond me.",
      "nm27aasith07004_.mp3": "Well, let me guess! You intend to collect this reward, right?",
      "nm27aasith07010_.mp3": "See? What did I tell you?",
      "nm28absur201008_.mp3": "They looked wrong? Hmmm... this whole place smells wrong. Like an Urellian urgoth egg gone bad in the hamper.",
      "nm28absur201012_.mp3": "Must be those reliable and finely tuned senses of yours, mercenary.",
      "nm33aalash11006_.mp3": "Well, if you'd seen us before, we wouldn't be newcomers, would we?",
      "nm33aalash11062_.mp3": "Twelve? No, wait, thirteen!",
      "nm33aalash11064_.mp3": "Thank you. It takes effort to be properly irreverent at my age.",
      "nm33aalash11075_.mp3": "Twelve? No, wait, thirteen!",
      "nm33aalash11077_.mp3": "Thank you. It takes effort to be properly irreverent at my age.",
      "nm33aapros17021_.mp3": "If a Sith told you to go jump off a cliff, would you?",
      "nm33aapros18022_.mp3": "If a Sith told you to go jump off a cliff, would you?",
      "nm33aashaa19013_.mp3": "Well, if you can't think of anything cruel you really shouldn't be out here, young man, should you?",
      "nm33aayuth21110_.mp3": "My hearing's not so good. I'm just pleased my nice master doesn't beat me so much anymore, yes sir.",
      "nm35aajole09000_.mp3": "There'll be time for chatter after we find whatever has caused this disturbance in the Force. It's dangerous, so keep on your toes.",
      "nm35aajole09001_.mp3": "Got something on your mind, do you?",
      "nm35aajole09007_.mp3": "Oh, I know plenty about Kashyyyk. You think someone doesn't live here for twenty years and pick up a thing or two?",
      "nm35aajole09008_.mp3": "Chances are that by the time I finished telling you about it all, you would have found out for yourself. So there's no reason for me to start blathering on.",
      "nm35aajole09009_.mp3": "It should be enough for me to tell you that there's kilometer after kilometer of trees on this planet. The deeper you go, the more dangerous it gets.",
      "nm35aajole09010_.mp3": "If you're smart, you stay on top with the Wookiees. Go deep, however, and you may find some things you weren't expecting.",
      "nm35aajole09011_.mp3": "And that's about all I got to say about that. Now let's get going.",
      "nm35aajole09012_.mp3": "Well, unless you're one of the local species and end up being slaughtered or enslaved, Tatooine's a nice enough desert.",
      "nm35aajole09013_.mp3": "Pfah. Korriban's a rock. Mind the Sith.",
      "nm35aajole09014_.mp3": "Manaan's an unusual place. Not for its water, mind you... it's the kolto. Healing juice. Only place where it occurs in the galaxy.",
      "nm35aajole09015_.mp3": "Hmph. Hard to say what this planet is. Been lost for thousands of years, if not more. *Sniff* Smells like bad, bad karma so watch your step.",
      "nm35aajole09016_.mp3": "It's a ship. To be more specific, it's *your* ship. You tell me.",
      "nm35aajole09017_.mp3": "No more than you. Get going.",
      "nm35aajole09019_.mp3": "How many could you possibly need? And besides, I don't have enough supplies on me to put some more together.",
      "nm35aajole09020_.mp3": "Ask me later when you're actually in need and I'm less tired. I'm not a kit factory, you know.",
      "nm35aajole09021_.mp3": "Hmph. I suppose I could whip up something, uh... you know... few herbs and such. You do know that the best alternative is not to get hurt, right?",
      "nm35aajole09022_.mp3": "Not to say that you go leaping into the path of blaster fire or anything, but I know how you young people get. Here, take it.",
      "nm35aajole09024_.mp3": "What? You think because I'm a hermit I've always been a hermit? Just because I haven't seen Sunry for twenty years doesn't mean he's not a friend.",
      "nm35aajole09025_.mp3": "A man could have changed a lot in that span of time, though. But to become a murderer? Oh, mm mm mm. I can't see it. That's not the Sunry I knew.",
      "nm35aajole09026_.mp3": "He was a good man. Put me up in his home for a year back after I left the order. War hero, too, or so I hear.",
      "nm35aajole09027_.mp3": "I wouldn't mind helping the fellow, if we can. I owe it to him. Or you can be a young monkey-lizard and ignore me, I guess... well, I don't expect much these days.",
      "nm35aajole09029_.mp3": "So you do. I once had a holodisc that showed Mandalore doing the three-step jiggy with a rancor beast. Marvelous technology we have.",
      "nm35aajole09031_.mp3": "It may have been. I believe you should, at least, keep that possibility in mind.",
      "nm35aajole09032_.mp3": "If somebody was going to go through all the trouble of making a false tape to indict Sunry you think it would have 'turned up' before now.",
      "nm35aajole09033_.mp3": "Maybe it would be a good idea to show the tape to Sunry. Perhaps he has an explanation. Or perhaps he doesn't.",
      "nm35aajole09034_.mp3": "It would be sad if this proved that Sunry did actually perform this crime, but... the truth is the truth. Whether I like it or not.",
      "nm35aajole09036_.mp3": "You did what was necessary. Sunry was guilty, as sad as that fact makes me, justice had to be done.",
      "nm35aajole09037_.mp3": "Doesn't matter that his victim was a Sith or that he was once a hero. I only wish that my old friend hadn't done it.",
      "nm35aajole09038_.mp3": "But that's the thing about wishes. They don't come true. And now Sunry's dead, which is a shame. He *was* a good man, you know... once.",
      "nm35aajole09039_.mp3": "Bah. I don't want to talk about this anymore. My jaw aches.",
      "nm35aajole09040_.mp3": "You defended him well enough. I wish we had had time to look into matters more fully, but wishing is only useful for the young and idealistic.",
      "nm35aajole09041_.mp3": "What's done is done. The Republic will likely appeal the matter eventually and he'll be free. I just... I just would like to know if that's best.",
      "nm35aajole09042_.mp3": "Sunry was a good man once. And a good friend. I'll miss him.",
      "nm35aajole09043_.mp3": "Innocent, mm? I don't know what to make of it, to tell the truth. Do you think justice has been done?",
      "nm35aajole09045_.mp3": "I see. I am not so sure. If he did kill that woman, Sunry's going to have to live with that on his conscience.",
      "nm35aajole09046_.mp3": "And if he's justified her death in his mind... well... Sunry was a good man, once. I only hope that is still the case. I enjoyed his company.",
      "nm35aajole09048_.mp3": "But that has little to do with the law, does it? A sad state of affairs, that. Too bad, really... Sunry was a good man, once.",
      "nm35aajole09050_.mp3": "You got yourself a fast little ship. Heh. I'd forgotten what engines sounded like. The closest thing to that on Kashyyyk is an uller in mating season. Ugh! Frightful.",
      "nm35aajole09052_.mp3": "Or it could be for the free food. What's the gunk that comes out of the synthesizer on this bucket, anyway? Do you never clean the darned thing?",
      "nm35aajole09054_.mp3": "I'm old, damn it! I'm allowed to be enigmatic when I want to be, and don't you go telling me otherwise.",
      "nm35aajole09055_.mp3": "You know, you remind me of someone else I knew ages ago. Pleasant enough fellow, great destiny... all of that. Breath like a bantha.",
      "nm35aajole09057_.mp3": "Oh ho ho, very funny. Is it my fault that some people are so easily annoyed? They're like impatient little children. With blasters.",
      "nm35aajole09058_.mp3": "Anyway, where was I? Oh, yes. Andor Vex, was his name. The Force swirled around him like a hurricane, that's how great his destiny was.",
      "nm35aajole09060_.mp3": "No, you wouldn't have. Sometimes swirling Force is just swirling Force. It gets us old Jedis excited at our age so we go \"ooo, destiny!\"",
      "nm35aajole09061_.mp3": "Well, it turned out that poor Andor believed a wee bit too much in the infallibility of that destiny. That overconfidence turned out to be his downfall.",
      "nm35aajole09063_.mp3": "I don't know. Are you overconfident? I hadn't noticed. Even if I had, I would never comment on it. We're talking about Andor, remember?",
      "nm35aajole09064_.mp3": "Let's see... oh, yes. Andor's downfall. I was pretty young, myself, when it happened. At the time, I thought that Andor's destiny couldn't be more boring.",
      "nm35aajole09066_.mp3": "Well, let's just say that I was a strapping young lad with a full head of hair and Coruscant was a small town with a well, heh heh.",
      "nm35aajole09067_.mp3": "I was just about to abandon Andor to whatever the Force intended for him when his ship was overtaken by a Dimean warship.",
      "nm35aajole09068_.mp3": "Now, you've probably never heard of the Dimeans, but at the time they were a nasty lot led by a nastier overlord named Kraat. Tall fellow. Big teeth.",
      "nm35aajole09069_.mp3": "Kraat has us hauled onto the bridge of his ship for questioning, and that's when I knew that Andor's destiny was at hand.",
      "nm35aajole09071_.mp3": "Of course he did! Haven't you been listening? It was not in the way you'd probably expect, though.",
      "nm35aajole09073_.mp3": "Swirling Force, remember? Jedi here? Granted, I was just interpreting the signs, but we get trained in that sort of thing. More or less.",
      "nm35aajole09075_.mp3": "Well, Andor decides that his destiny makes him invulnerable and starts making all sorts of demands. Free me now, I'm not answering questions, blah blah blah. Don't you know who I am?",
      "nm35aajole09076_.mp3": "Kraat decides he's had enough and begins crushing Andor's neck. I told the boy he should have kept his mouth shut. I think he agreed, too... or those could have just been gurgling noises. Well... well, anyway.",
      "nm35aajole09077_.mp3": "Finally, Kraat has enough of Andor and tosses him aside into this giant energy intake shaft. Andor gets sucked in and starts bouncing around, heh, screaming... heh.",
      "nm35aajole09078_.mp3": "Maybe Andor hit something sensitive on the way down or just didn't agree with the reactor core, next thing I know all the ship's alarms are ringing.",
      "nm35aajole09080_.mp3": "Everyone panics and I run, barely making it to the ship in time before the explosion. Kraat dies horribly, and the Dimeans never quite recovered.",
      "nm35aajole09081_.mp3": "Changed the political course of the entire sector for centuries to come. I'd call that quite a destiny, wouldn't you?",
      "nm35aajole09083_.mp3": "Well, now, that's the ingratitude of youth for you. I relate an exciting tale and do I get thanked for it? No, no, it's all 'me me me!' Hmph.",
      "nm35aajole09085_.mp3": "What?! Are you kidding?! What are the odds of that happening, anyway? A billion to one?",
      "nm35aajole09086_.mp3": "You should do so well as to be sucked into the engine of some evil Sith Lord, you know. Andor was a hero... sort of.",
      "nm35aajole09088_.mp3": "Well, hey, the chances may not be great, but when one has the opportunity to see something like that twice in a lifetime...",
      "nm35aajole09089_.mp3": "Anyway, go on. My throat is dry and you're making me cranky. Shoo!",
      "nm35aajole09091_.mp3": "You know, if you keep interrupting, it will take even longer. Have you no patience at all? How did you get as old as you are anyway?",
      "nm35aajole09093_.mp3": "Well, he had a much better food dispenser than you do. That and the fact that even then I wasn't an altogether impatient *twit*.",
      "nm35aajole09095_.mp3": "Does it have to have a point? I thought we were just talking about Andor. Is something wrong with your attention span?",
      "nm35aajole09097_.mp3": "I am not! I've no need to make things up, with my poor memory and all. You just sit still and let me finish, damn it.",
      "nm35aajole09099_.mp3": "Well, it's not so much a hurricane as a slight breeze. But that doesn't mean anything: destiny is sometimes in the eye of the beholder.",
      "nm35aajole09101_.mp3": "I did. Just because someone has the Force swirling about them doesn't always mean they have a great destiny, but it doesn't hurt to check it out.",
      "nm35aajole09103_.mp3": "No, but it could be. An Anduvian salt tablet would clear that right up, you know.",
      "nm35aajole09105_.mp3": "So I am. Tell you what... when you get to be my age, you can go ahead and answer any question you like, too. You have my permission.",
      "nm35aajole09107_.mp3": "How impatient can one person be? You must have driven your mother mad. All that gurgling and fussing... heh, babies are cute, but annoying.",
      "nm35aajole09109_.mp3": "Wow, you're not much for interrogation, are you? Is this as hard as you try? Remind me to sign up for your next torture session.",
      "nm35aajole09111_.mp3": "No, I never did, did I?",
      "nm35aajole09113_.mp3": "Of course you do. I know things, remember? You think you could make it around this part of the galaxy without me? Don't answer that.",
      "nm35aajole09114_.mp3": "At any rate, I already told you why I wanted to leave. I'd seen everything I wanted to on Kashyyyk. Time to go, time to move on.",
      "nm35aajole09116_.mp3": "To bed. I'm old and tired, you know.",
      "nm35aajole09118_.mp3": "How many kilometer-high trees can you find an interest in before you figure you've had enough? I'd bet you can't be bothered to stay in one room for more than fifteen minutes.",
      "nm35aajole09119_.mp3": "And then there's all the critters in the Shadowlands... I'm just happy to be back in space, doing something new. Is that too much to ask?",
      "nm35aajole09121_.mp3": "So I could. Not having a ship does tend to put a damper on that kind of idea, however.",
      "nm35aajole09122_.mp3": "I'll admit... for all its flaws, Kashyyyk was home enough. But when you came along and I saw the destiny you had before you, I couldn't help but be intrigued.",
      "nm35aajole09124_.mp3": "Of course not. Weren't you listening last time? I can see that you have a destiny before you... but the details are far from clear.",
      "nm35aajole09125_.mp3": "In fact, everything about you that I can see is odd. Slightly off, as if my eyes are trying to trick me. Something... something is very dark about you...",
      "nm35aajole09126_.mp3": "... but bah! I'm sure you don't need to hear my ruminations. You've probably got enough nosy Jedi offering you one opinion after another to make you sick.",
      "nm35aajole09128_.mp3": "Your future will come of its own accord, trust me. Sometimes navel-gazing at it doesn't get you anywhere.",
      "nm35aajole09129_.mp3": "I wouldn't worry about it too much, if I were you. You remind me a bit of Nomi, heh heh, and that can't be all bad.",
      "nm35aajole09131_.mp3": "Nomi Sunrider. She came late to the Force, just as you have, and became one of the greatest Jedi ever. Oh, fine, fine lass.",
      "nm35aajole09132_.mp3": "Whether you'll follow the same path remains to be seen. For one thing, we'll never get anywhere if you stand around chatting up old men all day...",
      "nm35aajole09134_.mp3": "Oh, stop being such a baby. Are you always so quick to turn aside an ally? Got too many of them, do you?",
      "nm35aajole09136_.mp3": "Nonsense. Have I ever refused to help you when you asked? How confused can one person be, anyway?",
      "nm35aajole09138_.mp3": "Good, since I didn't offer to be one. You think anyone would want to mentor you with that kind of attitude? Not me, I'm past that.",
      "nm35aajole09139_.mp3": "One thing I will say is that this little escapade does remind me a bit of my adventuring days before the war. Ahh, those were exciting times.",
      "nm35aajole09140_.mp3": "Or at least it would remind me of those times if we didn't stand around. What's keeping you? You're too young to be so talkative. Shoo! Shoo!",
      "nm35aajole09142_.mp3": "Well I for one am quite content to let you make your own mistakes. Just because I want to see where this ends up doesn't mean I need to tell you how to get there.",
      "nm35aajole09144_.mp3": "I'll remind you that *you're* the one who started pumping me for information. Like an old man doesn't have anything better to do. Hmph.",
      "nm35aajole09146_.mp3": "Interest? Well, I certainly don't have a vested interest... call it more idle curiosity. Your destiny is... rather unclear.",
      "nm35aajole09148_.mp3": "Have I offered a single opinion? No, I haven't, though you could do far worse than hear a couple of mine. Your destiny, after all, is rather unclear.",
      "nm35aajole09150_.mp3": "You got a smart mouth on you there, you know that? If ullers could talk, they'd sound like that.",
      "nm35aajole09152_.mp3": "There, now, was that so hard? An old man has to be allowed some petty eccenticities. Nice to see you agree, for once.",
      "nm35aajole09154_.mp3": "The hermit says he's tired of living alone in the giant forest and you find that hard to believe? How cynical are you?",
      "nm35aajole09156_.mp3": "You live in an overgrown stump with the tachs beating down your door and you tell me how happy you would be. I was pleased just to have visitors.",
      "nm35aajole09158_.mp3": "Elusive? Me, elusive? Heh. Obviously you've never tried to grab a Twi'lek dancing girl after drinking too much Ondaran willek juice.",
      "nm35aajole09160_.mp3": "My, my, somebody woke up on the wrong side of the starship this morning, I see. Is that a chip on your shoulder or are you a bit surly today?",
      "nm35aajole09162_.mp3": "Did I say that? Strange the tricks memory plays on you when you get older.",
      "nm35aajole09164_.mp3": "Didn't I say that my past was my affair? You don't see me poking and prodding you with questions, do you?",
      "nm35aajole09166_.mp3": "Well that's a relief. Maybe an old man can finally get some peace around here. Now, run along and do whatever you were doing, already.",
      "nm35aajole09168_.mp3": "I'm not here to satisfy your curiosity! No staring at the old man, that's what the sign says, dammit!",
      "nm35aajole09170_.mp3": "Hmph. I might be. But a mouthy young thing like yourself shouldn't get to call me an old coot, dammit.",
      "nm35aajole09171_.mp3": "And besides... you don't really want to hear about me. We're talking ancient history, probably before you were born. History bores kids. Proven fact.",
      "nm35aajole09173_.mp3": "Oh fine, fine, have it your way. Just don't cry about it later.",
      "nm35aajole09176_.mp3": "So you're not. Fine, have it your way. Just don't say I didn't warn you.",
      "nm35aajole09177_.mp3": "Yes, yes, I was an adventurer. Happy now? I wasn't even done with my Jedi training back then. I had a full head of hair and an eagerness to see absolutely everything.",
      "nm35aajole09178_.mp3": "Sound familiar? The Council was never very happy with willful, brash Jolee Bindo, you see. Even less so when I began my smuggling career.",
      "nm35aajole09180_.mp3": "Don't look at me like that, dammit! I wasn't always the wrinkled coot I am now, you know. I can still fight, too, so wipe off that smirk I see there.",
      "nm35aajole09182_.mp3": "You're very sure of that, are you? My, my, you must be very learned and experienced to know so many things. At any rate, I was still a Padawan at the time.",
      "nm35aajole09184_.mp3": "At the time the Ukatis system was interdicted by its own King. He preferred to keep his people starving and poor, all the better to oppress them.",
      "nm35aajole09185_.mp3": "The Senate was trying to negotiate a peace, but they were getting nowhere as usual. I decided I wasn't going to wait.",
      "nm35aajole09186_.mp3": "I found myself a ship and a partner and we began smuggling food and supplies to the Ukatis citizenry through the blockade.",
      "nm35aajole09188_.mp3": "Oh, it was. I was a half-decent pilot in those days... and with the Force guiding me, we made it through some tough spots nobody else would have.",
      "nm35aajole09190_.mp3": "Pilot, smuggler... several other things, too. Or did you suppose I was always a crotchety hermit?",
      "nm35aajole09192_.mp3": "Well... we didn't *buy* all the equipment, per se. Some were happy to donate goods. Some we just, ah, knew had more than they could use...",
      "nm35aajole09194_.mp3": "'Stole' is such a harsh word. They would have donated those goods readily enough if they were compassionate. I considered it a tax on the greedy.",
      "nm35aajole09195_.mp3": "We only got caught once. A lone Ukatish frigate shot us down and forced a crash landing. I thought the Force had abandoned me, as I remember.",
      "nm35aajole09197_.mp3": "Well, as it happens, getting shot down turned out to be very fortunate. That day was the day I...",
      "nm35aajole09199_.mp3": "Well, that... that was the day I met my wife.",
      "nm35aajole09201_.mp3": "It's alright. When you're digging through the trash, you shouldn't be surprised when you encounter something unpleasant.",
      "nm35aajole09203_.mp3": "You know another way to get a wife? But, yes... that's when I met her.",
      "nm35aajole09205_.mp3": "No. No, that was a good memory. There are just... much worse ones that followed.",
      "nm35aajole09206_.mp3": "I... If it's all the same to you, I'd prefer to stop talking now. My mouth is starting to draw flies.",
      "nm35aajole09208_.mp3": "Oh, so you're going to speak for the Force now, are you? I deserved to crash, is that it?",
      "nm35aajole09210_.mp3": "Hmph. As I recall, I'm not the only person in this conversation who's been shot down out of the sky recently.",
      "nm35aajole09212_.mp3": "Why not? There were millions of people crying out for aid. What else was I supposed to do?",
      "nm35aajole09214_.mp3": "Don't be stupid. Are you doing nothing? If nothing's not good enough for you there's no reason it should have been good enough for me back then, either.",
      "nm35aajole09216_.mp3": "I don't want to talk about that.",
      "nm35aajole09218_.mp3": "Maybe, but I doubt it. I'm made stubborn that way.",
      "nm35aajole09220_.mp3": "Now that's a unique method of getting someone to talk. Thunder about like a bantha in a circuit shop. Does that work for you often?",
      "nm35aajole09222_.mp3": "Yes you do. You may mean well enough, but my private affairs are just that: private.",
      "nm35aajole09223_.mp3": "Let me tell you something. Once you've lived as many years as I have, you'll have yourself a long, long list of memories.",
      "nm35aajole09224_.mp3": "If you're lucky, most of them will be good. If you're not, some will be bad. If you're really unlucky, some will be so bad you never want to be reminded of them again... ever.",
      "nm35aajole09225_.mp3": "You'll go far away, to a place that doesn't hold any memories at all. And there you'll be happy just to forget and be forgotten.",
      "nm35aajole09227_.mp3": "You say that now, but I'm talking to you from across the breadth of many years experience. That is a gap I simply can't cross for you.",
      "nm35aajole09230_.mp3": "Heh. Partly, maybe. I doubt I could ever explain it to you fully, even if I wanted to.",
      "nm35aajole09232_.mp3": "There are worse things to call yourself, for better reasons. If you don't think it's even possible that you might be flinging those words at yourself one day, you're younger than I thought.",
      "nm35aajole09233_.mp3": "Let me ask you this: have you ever been in love? Truly in love, I mean, and not simple infatuation.",
      "nm35aajole09235_.mp3": "Exactly. You're still at the beginning of your life. There will be women in your life... perhaps many women... but if you're fortunate you'll find love once.",
      "nm35aajole09236_.mp3": "Exactly. You're still at the beginning of your life. There will be men in your life... perhaps many men... but if you're fortunate you'll find love once.",
      "nm35aajole09237_.mp3": "The Jedi, with their damnable sense of over-caution, would tell you love is something to avoid. Thankfully, anyone who's even partially alive knows that's not true.",
      "nm35aajole09239_.mp3": "Love doesn't lead to the dark side. Passion can lead to rage and fear, and can be controlled... but passion is not the same thing as love.",
      "nm35aajole09240_.mp3": "Controlling your passions while being in love... that's what they should teach you to beware. But love, itself, will save you... not condemn you.",
      "nm35aajole09241_.mp3": "Ahhhh, but listen to me go on as if I had all the answers. What do I know of love anymore? I'm just a lonely old man who's not even a Jedi.",
      "nm35aajole09243_.mp3": "Hmph. Maybe. Do you want to avoid the greatest things in life simply because they come with some complications?",
      "nm35aajole09244_.mp3": "Love causes pain, certainly. Inevitably love is going to lead to as much sorrow and regret as it does joy. I suppose there are perfect, eternal loves out there... but I haven't seen any.",
      "nm35aajole09245_.mp3": "How you deal with the bad part of love is what determines your character, what determines the dark side's hold over you.",
      "nm35aajole09247_.mp3": "I suppose it could. It would take a strong person to make that kind of commitment, I think. Someone with a great sense of self.",
      "nm35aajole09249_.mp3": "Bah. A life without risk is boring. Is that how you want to live? You want love, you've got to fight for it.",
      "nm35aajole09251_.mp3": "I haven't changed my mind. I'm still not going to talk about it. You go and find your own love if you want to know so badly.",
      "nm35aajole09252_.mp3": "I'll tell you one thing: sometimes, no matter how hard you try, you and the one you love simply aren't meant to be together.",
      "nm35aajole09253_.mp3": "The trick is to know when that is, to know when it's time to fight and when it's time to part ways.",
      "nm35aajole09254_.mp3": "Hmph... there I go waxing philosophical again. Somebody blast me already! Let's get going before I start talking in riddles, dammit!",
      "nm35aajole09256_.mp3": "Don't I? Hmph. Maybe you're right. It seems whatever I have to say is falling on deaf ears, anyhow.",
      "nm35aajole09257_.mp3": "So go on, go on, run amok and kiss the bantha for all I care. I won't comment on it.",
      "nm35aajole09259_.mp3": "You do, do you? I wouldn't listen too closely... I'm no authority on anything. I just think that the greatest things in life shouldn't be avoided because they come with a few complications.",
      "nm35aajole09262_.mp3": "And why not? All this nonsense about avoiding love is so much foo-foo. I shouldn't be the only one who realizes that.",
      "nm35aajole09264_.mp3": "Heh heh. Who said I left the Jedi?",
      "nm35aajole09267_.mp3": "Well, technically, I was only a Padawan... not that that makes a difference to most. But as for the order, itself... no, I never left it. It left *me*.",
      "nm35aajole09269_.mp3": "You know what I hate? Well... you know, lots of things, really. But I'm old and easily annoyed. But that's beside the point. What I *really* hate are how most people view the Jedi.",
      "nm35aajole09270_.mp3": "Everyone thinks that Jedi are perfect, that they can do no wrong. They think the Jedi Council is completely incapable of injustice.",
      "nm35aajole09272_.mp3": "Hmph. I guess you aren't as stupid as you sometimes act. No doubt you've been on the receiving end of Jedi justice at least once, eh?",
      "nm35aajole09274_.mp3": "Damn right I disagree. The Jedi are just as capable of injustice as anyone else. They may *try* harder, sure, but sometimes they get it wrong.",
      "nm35aajole09276_.mp3": "Quiet, you. I'm not talking about me. Talking about the Jedi as a whole. They are just as capable of imperfection and injustice as anyone else, as you can obviously see.",
      "nm35aajole09277_.mp3": "And I'm not even talking about how some of us fall to the dark side. No, that's plenty indication of our fallibility, but it's something else entirely.",
      "nm35aajole09278_.mp3": "No, I'm talking about how, more often than not, your average robe-wearing Jedi can try to do the right thing and still be completely *wrong*.",
      "nm35aajole09280_.mp3": "*sigh* I suppose I'm not being very clear, am I?",
      "nm35aajole09281_.mp3": "Come to think of it, I don't have to be clear. Someone my age is entitled to ramble, dammit! But for your sake I'll try to explain.",
      "nm35aajole09282_.mp3": "I'll tell you a little tale about a Jedi Master I once knew. Hortath, I think. Or was it Hartoth? I could never get it straight...",
      "nm35aajole09284_.mp3": "Where was I, then? Oh. Oh, yes... Master Hortath. He was a kindly old Jedi who meant well, but the most near-sighted thing in the Core, I swear.",
      "nm35aajole09285_.mp3": "He would walk into walls, knock over tables, mistake apprentices for rancor beasts... that sort of thing. And he was too proud to submit to proper treatment.",
      "nm35aajole09286_.mp3": "Some used to counsel him and urged \"Use the Force, Master Hortath. Allow the Force to see for you.\" But he refused to believe that his eyes were failing.",
      "nm35aajole09287_.mp3": "He simply squinted more and more as the years went on, the other Jedi resignedly passing it off as the amusing quirk of a compassionate old man.",
      "nm35aajole09289_.mp3": "I'm not finished yet! Now shush.",
      "nm35aajole09292_.mp3": "So one day a young Padawan meets Master Hortath in the courtyard and, not knowing of his blindness, asks him for directions to the Council.",
      "nm35aajole09293_.mp3": "Quite sure of himself, Hortath gave the lad directions... which happened to lead back outside and away from the enclave.",
      "nm35aajole09294_.mp3": "The Padawan is confused, naturally. He asks if Master Hortath is sure, and of course Master Hortath says that he is.",
      "nm35aajole09295_.mp3": "The Padawan suggests that perhaps he should ask someone else... but the proud Hortath now feels insulted. He tells the Padawan to take the route he prescribed and no other.",
      "nm35aajole09296_.mp3": "Rather dejectedly, the Padawan did as he was told... and so ended up leaving the Jedi Order forever.",
      "nm35aajole09297_.mp3": "It was decided that the boy's fate was to leave the Order anyway... though whether that was out of respect for Hortath or because the boy went on to something else, well, we'll never know.",
      "nm35aajole09301_.mp3": "Not much. I never knew the Padawan nor met Master Hortath, himself. He was before my time.",
      "nm35aajole09304_.mp3": "No, no. Both of them were from before my time. Well before the Sith Wars, even.",
      "nm35aajole09306_.mp3": "The tale is about blindness and I thought the point was clear. At any rate, you think about it. You're the one who asked why the Jedi left me, remember?",
      "nm35aajole09307_.mp3": "Now let's get going. My feet are itching for a good run.",
      "nm35aajole09309_.mp3": "Considering that it's about blindness, I think that's an appropriate response. You're the one who asked why the Jedi left me, remember?",
      "nm35aajole09311_.mp3": "*Sigh* You know the problem with the youth of today? They're young.",
      "nm35aajole09313_.mp3": "You're the one who was asking me about the Jedi, dammit! Now do you want the story or not?",
      "nm35aajole09316_.mp3": "Boring you, am I? Well you just keep your questions to yourself next time. No need for old men to go and make nuisances of themselves.",
      "nm35aajole09318_.mp3": "No, no. The Jedi always treated me well. It would be foolish and untrue to say otherwise. That's not what I meant, anyway.",
      "nm35aajole09320_.mp3": "That's true, but it's not what I meant. I guess I'm not being clear, am I?",
      "nm35aajole09322_.mp3": "Oh, is it? Hmph. There are moments when I think you must be much older than you seem... but this isn't one of them.",
      "nm35aajole09324_.mp3": "Something wrong with your ears? I thought folks only went deaf when they got to my age. I follow the Jedi Way and use the Force, don't I? That makes me a Jedi last time I checked.",
      "nm35aajole09325_.mp3": "But the order, itself, the Jedi Council and so forth... no, I'm not a part of that and haven't been for a long time. And good riddance, I say!",
      "nm35aajole09329_.mp3": "Hmph. A rogue, am I? You speak as if there must be something wrong with me, like not being part of the order makes me a criminal.",
      "nm35aajole09331_.mp3": "Don't get so uppity, dammit! The point I was trying to make, if you decide to actually listen, is that I never left the order. The order left *me*.",
      "nm35aajole09333_.mp3": "Bad, bad men. Women, too, to be fair.",
      "nm35aajole09335_.mp3": "Oh, indeed. They make a fine sandwich, also. Heh heh heh. But don't tell the Jedi Council I said that.",
      "nm35aajole09337_.mp3": "Who's playing games? Ask the next Sith you see if they're bad and they'll set you straight.",
      "nm35aajole09339_.mp3": "*sigh* And just what gave you the impression that I know anything more about the Sith than you do?",
      "nm35aajole09341_.mp3": "Oh... that's right. Damn the ears of the young! I was expecting you to be your usual inattentive self when I mentioned that.",
      "nm35aajole09342_.mp3": "So it's true, yes, I fought plenty of Sith. That was during the time of Exar Kun... oh, fourty years ago now? Has it been that long?",
      "nm35aajole09344_.mp3": "No, no, of course not. The Sith have come and gone for ages. They were not called Sith many thousands of years ago, perhaps, but the dark side was always present without a doubt.",
      "nm35aajole09345_.mp3": "Oh, sure, occasionally the light side comes close to vanquishing the dark, but the dark always returns.",
      "nm35aajole09346_.mp3": "The fact that Exar Kun was defeated didn't mean the Sith would never return, as they obviously have now. Everyone knows that.",
      "nm35aajole09348_.mp3": "That... is not a pleasant time to remember. After Exar Kun fell to the dark side, he attempted to recruit other Jedi to his cause.",
      "nm35aajole09349_.mp3": "What surprised us... what took us completely unprepared... was how utterly successful he was. Many Jedi joined him and became Sith, themselves.",
      "nm35aajole09350_.mp3": "Why they did I... I will never truly know. But they did. Battle broke out throughout the order... pupil against master, we fought ourselves...",
      "nm35aajole09352_.mp3": "Yes. More than difficult... next to impossible. How do you fight against someone you love?",
      "nm35aajole09354_.mp3": "Easy now to call them traitors. Tell me... how do you fight against someone that you love?",
      "nm35aajole09355_.mp3": "Bah. I dislike such memories. It leaves a taste in the mouth that... it is a sadness I thought I had put aside long ago.",
      "nm35aajole09356_.mp3": "Ask me again about the war some other time. Just... not now. I would prefer to be by myself for now.",
      "nm35aajole09358_.mp3": "I've often held the opinion that history has one basic flaw: it is seldom heeded.",
      "nm35aajole09359_.mp3": "So go on and greet the world with your spite. Let's see where it takes you. You certainly don't need to hear any more from me.",
      "nm35aajole09361_.mp3": "Ah. Exar was a Jedi who was... corrupted... by ghosts of the old Sith. Or so they say. He attempted to conquer the Republic and create a new Golden Age of the Sith.",
      "nm35aajole09363_.mp3": "Better to say he was defeated... but essentially, yes. The victory did not come easily, however.",
      "nm35aajole09365_.mp3": "A Sith believes he commands the Force... but it is the dark side who commands him. You know this, there is little else I could truly add.",
      "nm35aajole09369_.mp3": "Not particularly.",
      "nm35aajole09372_.mp3": "[Success] I suppose you're going to nag me until I cough it up, aren't you? Nothing is private anymore, it looks like.",
      "nm35aajole09373_.mp3": "*sigh* There's no escaping it, I guess. So be it.",
      "nm35aajole09374_.mp3": "My wife's name was Nayama. She was the Ukatis enforcer who shot me out of the sky, if you remember.",
      "nm35aajole09376_.mp3": "My wife had plenty to do with the war. Upon meeting her, I knew right away that she was strong in the Force. That's why she was able to shoot me down.",
      "nm35aajole09377_.mp3": "Nayama was a marvel of a woman. Fiery, determined, smart... she dragged me to the capital and foiled three of my attempts to escape prison. Oh, and that body...",
      "nm35aajole09379_.mp3": "Well... yes, that. Needless to say I eventually won her over. That was after I kidnapped her upon being broken out of the Ukatis prison, mind you. But uh, that's another story entirely.",
      "nm35aajole09380_.mp3": "At any rate, I wanted to train her in the Jedi way. The Council refused my request, naturally. I was still a Padawan at the time.",
      "nm35aajole09382_.mp3": "I did. I wasn't the first and I won't be the last. The problem with self-righteous folk is they think they're more right than everyone else.",
      "nm35aajole09384_.mp3": "Easy to say so now. At the time I just thought I was right.",
      "nm35aajole09386_.mp3": "Nayama was intrigued by the idea of becoming a Jedi. She liked the idea of power too much, perhaps, but I certainly didn't see that at the time.",
      "nm35aajole09387_.mp3": "I believed in her and trained her in secret. I ignored her willful nature... I loved her too much to see fault in her.",
      "nm35aajole09388_.mp3": "And she loved me, too. I know she did. At the time, our love was a shared bliss... better than anything I had known before or since.",
      "nm35aajole09390_.mp3": "Exar Kun is what happened. Nayama was inspired by Exar's promises of a new Golden Age. She wanted to join him.",
      "nm35aajole09391_.mp3": "She came to me, pleading with me to throw aside what she called the decrepit trappings of the Jedi... to join her in Exar's war.",
      "nm35aajole09393_.mp3": "I... hadn't thought so. Not right then. I was too proud to believe that of her. I had trained her myself... I loved her.",
      "nm35aajole09395_.mp3": "No of course I didn't kill her. How could I? I pleaded with her to reconsider, to think about what she was doing.",
      "nm35aajole09397_.mp3": "I pleaded with her to reconsider, to think about all that she was throwing away... to think about what she would become.",
      "nm35aajole09398_.mp3": "She would have none of it. Finally, in frustration, she attacked me. She drew her lightsaber and attempted to strike me down.",
      "nm35aajole09399_.mp3": "It was a scene being repeated everywhere throughout the galaxy. Pupil against master. In my case... it was a long and terrible battle, but I defeated her.",
      "nm35aajole09401_.mp3": "No... no. I had her at my mercy, disarmed and defenseless. She looked up at me and she knew... she knew I couldn't do it.",
      "nm35aajole09403_.mp3": "But I should have. Sometimes I convince myself otherwise... but it's no use. She had fallen to the dark side when she raised her saber against me.",
      "nm35aajole09405_.mp3": "Yes. I think she truly fell the moment she raised up her saber against me. I have played that instant in my head... so many times.",
      "nm35aajole09407_.mp3": "Was I? Sometimes I convince myself that I couldn't have done otherwise... that I couldn't have seen that she had truly fallen to the dark side. But, yes, I was a fool.",
      "nm35aajole09408_.mp3": "And I let her go. To my shame, she went on to kill many Jedi during the war until she, herself, was slain in the final battle.",
      "nm35aajole09409_.mp3": "I grieved for her death, inevitable as it was, even as the Jedi Council put me on trial for my actions once the war was over.",
      "nm35aajole09411_.mp3": "I had trained Nayama against their wishes. I had failed to kill her when I had the chance, and she went on to kill others.",
      "nm35aajole09412_.mp3": "It was a travesty, of course. I told you that even the Jedi were capable of great injustices, didn't I?",
      "nm35aajole09414_.mp3": "Not at all. They found me innocent.",
      "nm35aajole09416_.mp3": "Of course I deserved to be punished. They found me innocent.",
      "nm35aajole09418_.mp3": "But I deserved to be tried. They found me innocent.",
      "nm35aajole09419_.mp3": "Even though I... deserved every punishment and more... they let me go. Mitigating circumstances, they said. I deserved compassion, they said.",
      "nm35aajole09420_.mp3": "That... that was when the Jedi left me. That was when they failed me.",
      "nm35aajole09422_.mp3": "No. Maybe you don't, at that.",
      "nm35aajole09424_.mp3": "For my pride? For my cowardice? Which do you think is the act more befitting a Jedi?",
      "nm35aajole09426_.mp3": "They may have been able to forgive me. I... could never forgive myself.",
      "nm35aajole09428_.mp3": "I...",
      "nm35aajole09429_.mp3": "Yes, I do, I suppose. Does that surprise you?",
      "nm35aajole09430_.mp3": "Ahhh... it is all so long ago. Lost in the winds, I suppose. Nobody cares what an old man believes anymore, do they?",
      "nm35aajole09431_.mp3": "Let's continue on with the task at hand. I would prefer to think of the present today.",
      "nm35aajole09433_.mp3": "Bah. You got ears that work, don't you? I was a smuggler, way way back. I got shot down once over Ukatis. THAT story, yes.",
      "nm35aajole09435_.mp3": "No I'm not senile, dammit! Not yet, anyway. Hmmm... well at least I don't think so. At any rate, I'll tell the story the way I want to.",
      "nm35aajole09436_.mp3": "[Failure] *Sigh* I'm not interested in your demands. I'll tell my story when I'm damn good and ready... which isn't now, so shoo!",
      "nm35aajole09438_.mp3": "Hmm. Such a charming and persuasive manner you have there. Forget it!",
      "nm35aajole09442_.mp3": "Oh, that was not until many years later, to tell the truth. I spent quite some time wandering the galaxy.",
      "nm35aajole09444_.mp3": "Why wouldn't they? I had refused my promotion to Jedi... I was a Padawan who had left the Order, nothing more.",
      "nm35aajole09445_.mp3": "I traveled from one civilized system to the next, never staying long. I don't even think I knew what I was searching for.",
      "nm35aajole09447_.mp3": "Nothing so extravagant. I merely traveled from place to place... I don't even think I knew what I was searching for.",
      "nm35aajole09448_.mp3": "It wasn't as if my travels were pleasant, either. There were plenty of folks who distrusted the Jedi after the war... or worse.",
      "nm35aajole09450_.mp3": "If people weren't treating me with suspicion, they were looking at me with greed. I don't know how many thought they could make use of me for their own ends.",
      "nm35aajole09451_.mp3": "I got so sick of the treachery and deceit I left the civilized parts of the galaxy and headed instead for the uncivilized parts.",
      "nm35aajole09453_.mp3": "Actually I was on my way somewhere else when I crash-landed on Kashyyyk. The ship I was using was a rust-bucket.",
      "nm35aajole09455_.mp3": "I'd taken some damage passing through an unexpected asteroid field, as I recall, but I wasn't completely without some systems. I could still guide her a bit when I crashed.",
      "nm35aajole09456_.mp3": "It wasn't what a would call the smoothest landing, especially considering I ended up smack in the depths of the Shadowlands. But I lived.",
      "nm35aajole09458_.mp3": "Hmph. I'm no mechanic. And besides, after you plunge nose-first into the trunk of a five-kilometer high tree, chances are you don't have much ship left.",
      "nm35aajole09460_.mp3": "Sure, why not? It seemed like an interesting enough place to spend a couple of decades exploring.",
      "nm35aajole09462_.mp3": "Hmmm. That was a challenge at first. You've seen the kind of creatures that exist down there... and you missed the really big ones.",
      "nm35aajole09463_.mp3": "I was still able to rely on the Force to keep me safe for the most part. The rest of the trick is keeping out of the way of most of the predators.",
      "nm35aajole09465_.mp3": "No, that's true. Still... most of the creatures grew accustomed to me, and I to them. At least none of them ever heard of a Jedi.",
      "nm35aajole09467_.mp3": "Bah, what do you know? I'd done enough wandering by that point, thank you very much. I felt at peace in the Shadowlands.",
      "nm35aajole09469_.mp3": "They did at first, oh yes. I can't say I was overly pleased to encounter a group of indigenous giant carpets either, I can assure you of that.",
      "nm35aajole09471_.mp3": "No, no. I was the intruder in their land, after all. They got to trust me well enough after a couple of decades of my aid.",
      "nm35aajole09473_.mp3": "Well that was after two decades of helping them. They certainly didn't trust me at first.",
      "nm35aajole09475_.mp3": "And why would I have been interested in that? You can't spend five minutes in a Wookiee village without coming out smelling like wet fur.",
      "nm35aajole09476_.mp3": "No, no, let them rule themselves. They can screw up their history just like every other race before them. No, I helped them in other ways.",
      "nm35aajole09478_.mp3": "When I could. I would assist the few young ones who would get lost in the Shadowlands or attacked unexpectedly by the wildlife.",
      "nm35aajole09479_.mp3": "I must say... for a while there, the Wookiees actually thought I was some kind of benevolent forest god. Amusing, really. I set them straight eventually.",
      "nm35aajole09481_.mp3": "At first, when the slavers took to hunting down lone Wookiees in the fringes of the Shadowlands, I did my best to divert them.",
      "nm35aajole09482_.mp3": "Later, when Chuundar made his deal I didn't see any point. I wasn't here to save them from their own sad follies, after all.",
      "nm35aajole09484_.mp3": "Nonsense. I had no idea that's what they were thinking for a long time. I just thought they were being friendly neighbours, leaving fruit and such for me.",
      "nm35aajole09485_.mp3": "Later, when I started to understand some of their grunting, I realized they would say prayers to the 'hairless one' before descending into the forest.",
      "nm35aajole09486_.mp3": "Hmph. Hairless one. I used to have plenty of hair, I tell you. *Ahem* Well, at any rate, it took a few bruises, but I set the record straight.",
      "nm35aajole09488_.mp3": "I traveled to Rrookworro and met with the chieftain in front of everyone. Freyyr swatted at me just to see if I was real or not.",
      "nm35aajole09489_.mp3": "I was real, and while it was a light swat, Wookiees are terribly strong. I was knocked out cold for a day. The Wookiees all thought it was quite funny.",
      "nm35aajole09491_.mp3": "Not really. Kashyyyk is a place you can feel very small in. It felt good to devote my time to helping people and living simply.",
      "nm35aajole09493_.mp3": "What can I say? I did it all for the Wookiees.",
      "nm35aajole09495_.mp3": "The Wookiees. Well, okay, maybe I needed some time on a quiet and remote planet... but if you ever need a friend, an incredibly strong hairball isn't a bad call.",
      "nm35aajole09497_.mp3": "Why, thank you. You're not so bad, yourself, all things considered.",
      "nm35aajole09499_.mp3": "I suppose I am, in a way, despite the smell. For a race of gardeners, they've developed quite interestingly.",
      "nm35aajole09501_.mp3": "You remember the alien computer, correct? Kashyyyk was meant to be an agricultural planet. The Wookiees were made for a reason.",
      "nm35aajole09502_.mp3": "Or, at least, that's what I'm thinking. But I'm an old man who's had a long time to develop that opinion, so don't argue with me.",
      "nm35aajole09504_.mp3": "See? Now you know how I feel half the time.",
      "nm35aajole09505_.mp3": "At any rate, we should be moving along, don't you think? If you sat around this long in the Shadowlands, a tach would eat you.",
      "nm35aajole09509_.mp3": "I suppose so. Not everyone would understand why the Jedi would suddenly start killing themselves and tearing up half the galaxy, would they?",
      "nm35aajole09511_.mp3": "I was lost. I couldn't conceive of returning to the Jedi, so what would you propose I'd done?",
      "nm35aajole09514_.mp3": "Are we back to *that* again?",
      "nm35aajole09518_.mp3": "Hmmm... what's the best way for me to approach this? Ah, perhaps it's time for a little story...",
      "nm35aajole09522_.mp3": "You just keep quiet there, you! I've had to put up with all your busy-body questions, haven't I? Well, now you'll listen to a story, dammit!",
      "nm35aajole09523_.mp3": "*ahem* Now where was I? Oh yes, the story... you almost made me forget about it. Nice try, but I'm not that old just yet. Heh heh.",
      "nm35aajole09524_.mp3": "Now, then. A young man sees a terribly venemous snake in his small village. Nervous, he watches the snake carefully until it leaves.",
      "nm35aajole09525_.mp3": "The young man follows the snake into the forest. He clears the branches out of its path and helps it over obstacles. He even works to keep it fed.",
      "nm35aajole09527_.mp3": "Shush! Many nights pass and still the young man continues to follow the snake. He even follows it into the sands of the great desert.",
      "nm35aajole09528_.mp3": "In the desert, the snake eventually grows hungry. It turns and bites the young man, its poison quickly working its way into his system.",
      "nm35aajole09529_.mp3": "Finally curious, the snake looks at the boy as he lays dying and asks, \"Why were you foolish enough to follow me all the way out into the desert?\"",
      "nm35aajole09530_.mp3": "The boy looks back and replies, \"Did I follow you? I thought I was leading you away from everyone else...\" And then he died.",
      "nm35aajole09532_.mp3": "Well, now, that's what I wanted to see for myself.",
      "nm35aajole09534_.mp3": "I've come a long way as it is, and I'm going to die anyway so that doesn't bother me in the least.",
      "nm35aajole09536_.mp3": "Well, then... let's hope you're not the young man, either.",
      "nm35aajole09538_.mp3": "The real question is whether or not I'm as frightened as I should be, isn't it?",
      "nm35aajole09540_.mp3": "I've told you before that you have a destiny before you. This does not mean, however, that your future is already written. They are not the same thing.",
      "nm35aajole09541_.mp3": "You have the choice of which direction you take your destiny in. More than engine-sucking Andor, certainly... but even he had a choice.",
      "nm35aajole09542_.mp3": "So far you've chosen to take a darker path. You know the consequences of that... we'll see if you decide to stay your course.",
      "nm35aajole09543_.mp3": "So far you've chosen to take the lighter path. Can you stay that course, even through the challenges ahead? We'll have to wait and see.",
      "nm35aajole09544_.mp3": "I'm not here to judge you or tell you which path to take. I'm here ready to offer you my help... should you ask for it.",
      "nm35aajole09545_.mp3": "I do that because I think it's important. More important than remaining in my home and pretending the galaxy doesn't exist. That's why I'm here.",
      "nm35aajole09547_.mp3": "Heh. I'm rather glad I came, too, really. You're a fine young lad. I hope... I hope things turn out well for you.",
      "nm35aajole09548_.mp3": "Heh. I'm rather glad I came, too, really. You're a fine young lass. I hope... I hope things turn out well for you.",
      "nm35aajole09550_.mp3": "Hmph. So you say, but it's my time to waste. Perhaps I can influence your decision, perhaps not... only time will tell, won't it?",
      "nm35aajole09552_.mp3": "That's very kind of you, but while elsewhere may be safer, elsewhere isn't where I think I should be. Besides... what's an old man to fear from death, eh?",
      "nm35aajole09553_.mp3": "Now, then... I've chatted enough for one lifetime. Let's get this show on the road, shall we?",
      "nm35aajole09555_.mp3": "Oh, I get it. Let's play with the old man's head, is it? He's half-senile, he'll forget I said anything! Wait uh, what was this about, anyway?",
      "nm35aajole09556_.mp3": "Stop bothering me with your questions! I can barely hear myself think.",
      "nm35aajole09557_.mp3": "*Sigh* I have no idea what you're talking about. Rabble rabble... what are you saying.",
      "nm35aalash07031_.mp3": "Now where are you going with this, I wonder?",
      "nm35aalash07033_.mp3": "It was just an idle question. Don't get so testy, damn it.",
      "nm35aautha22087_.mp3": "Hm. This should be interesting.",
      "nm35aautha22169_.mp3": "Heh. It shows innovative something, that's for sure.",
      "nm35aayuth24014_.mp3": "You don't say? Well, the master loves tombs, don't you master?",
      "nm35aayuth24206_.mp3": "You sound very much like... someone I used to know.",
      "nm37aafree04051_.mp3": "Now this you don't see every day. This... this is an old spirit full of the Force. I sense great sadness and regret. Walk carefully...",
      "nm37aafree04108_.mp3": "Hmph. The Sith consumed themselves, did they? Hm. I suppose that eventually that'd be all they'd have left to fight.",
      "nm37aashaa05006_.mp3": "Hmph. Typical. Always ready to jump at what they perceive to be the easier path.",
      "nm38aaassa01110_.mp3": "Well... so much for the sanctity of life?",
      "nm38abmeke03018_.mp3": "There's always remorse. And atonement. That's the harder path, though, boy. Think you can do that?",
      "nm39aastar99008_.mp3": "The Sith are big on the ancient power of the dark side. It only makes sense we'd find one of those Star Maps in a place like this.",
      "nm39aastar99009_.mp3": "So, now that we've got the Star Map what say we get out of here. The dampness in these tombs is hard on my old bones.",
      "nm39aayuth04107_.mp3": "Take an old man's advice, Yuthura. I know the Jedi aren't as perfect as they think they are, but they're way is a lot better than the way of the Sith.",
      "nm40aacart05048_.mp3": "I don't think I could use my Force powers to convince a whole squadron of troopers to let me go free, but maybe I can use it to get them to take me to a separate cell.",
      "nm40aacart05050_.mp3": "They'll probably only leave a single guard to watch over an old man like me. I could use the Force to convince the guard to set me free, then I could free the rest of you.",
      "nm40aacart05052_.mp3": "I've learned a few things in my time, kid. Don't underestimate the Force, for one. But it's your call. If you want to try a different plan, go ahead.",
      "nm40aajole07000_.mp3": "Guard, I need to speak with you.",
      "nm40aajole07004_.mp3": "This cell is too drafty. My old bones could catch a chill in here. We don't want that. You better let me out.",
      "nm40aajole07008_.mp3": "You shouldn't have let me out, sonny. That was wrong. Admiral Karath won't be too happy with you disobeying his orders.",
      "nm40aajole07012_.mp3": "You deserve to be locked up in the cell for disobeying orders.",
      "nm40aajole07018_.mp3": "Then I'll be sure to never let you out. Goodbye, sonny.",
      "nm40adcart01003_.mp3": "Bah. Malak won't kill her, don't be foolish. He'll want to use her battle meditation against the Republic. Turn her to the dark side and the Sith will always be victorious.",
      "nm40adcart01057_.mp3": "What about me? I already knew who you were, though it wasn't my place to tell you. Better off that you know, if you ask me.",
      "nm40adcart01058_.mp3": "Does it change anything? I'm not here to judge you. You'll do what you have to, and I'll help if I can.",
      "nm40adcart01079_.mp3": "Think you'd never heard of the Force before. Seems obvious enough to me it was meant to be.",
      "nm40adcart01124_.mp3": "Where is Bastila? What happened on that ship?",
      "nm41aablac01018_.mp3": "Wait a minute - do you understand these creatures? You must have learned their language when you came here in search of the secrets of the Star Forge. Back when you were still Revan.",
      "nm41aacart03003_.mp3": "She was always in danger of being seduced by the dark side, Carth. Bastila was strong, but she was always impatient and headstrong. Malak preyed upon her weaknesses.",
      "nm41aacart03004_.mp3": "This planet is a tainted place, the Star Forge and the Temple have twisted the Force into an instrument of evil - just as Malak has twisted Bastila into a servant of the Sith. ",
      "nm41aacart03006_.mp3": "Malak has a strong hold on Bastila now - it will be difficult for her to break free of his influence. Especially considering her long association with you.",
      "nm41aacart03008_.mp3": "In the end we all choose our own path, but keep in mind the role that you played in her downfall. You and the task assigned to her by the Jedi Council.",
      "nm41aacart03009_.mp3": "Remember the bond that was forged between you when she rekindled the spark that was your life. Through that bond she touched your memories... and also the echo of the dark taint within you.",
      "nm41aacart03013_.mp3": "No doubt. I must say that it's good to have you with us, my dear. For a minute there I thought you might decide... well, never mind what I thought.",
      "nm41aacart03036_.mp3": "I feel more confident now than I ever did before. The Force is with us, Mission.",
      "nm41aacart03037_.mp3": "Well, I'm an old man and I know you should take love when you can find it. Good for you two, I say.",
      "nm41aacart03039_.mp3": "Answer: I have no idea what they speak of, droid. Organic meatbags are an eternal mystery to me.",
      "nm41aacart03045_.mp3": "I'm not sure what's in store for us, but I sense Bastila still has a role to play. I have no doubt she'll be waiting for us on the Star Forge.",
      "nm41aacart03049_.mp3": "Weakness has nothing to do with the corruption of the dark side. A Jedi must always guard against pride and the desire for power. Especially you.",
      "nm41aacart03054_.mp3": "She's not dead, Carth - though that might have been easier for you to accept. She's fallen to the dark side and fled to the Star Forge.",
      "nm41aacart03115_.mp3": "You know, during our rather rapid descent I noticed the hulls of many crashed ships scattered across the landscape. Maybe the parts you need can be found among their wreckage.",
      "nm41aacart03126_.mp3": "I fear Bastila will find the lure of the dark side difficult to resist. She is strong in the Force, but she is also impulsive, willful and proud - as you once were, Revan.",
      "nm41aacart03128_.mp3": "I am glad to hear you say that. Now that you know your true identity I was afraid you might slip back over to the dark side. If Bastila feels as you do there may yet be hope for her.",
      "nm41aacart03130_.mp3": "Let us hope it does not come to that.",
      "nm41aacart03134_.mp3": "So do I, Mission. So do I.",
      "nm41aacart03136_.mp3": "I remember... though I hoped you would not be so quick to embrace the being you once were. If Bastila feels as you do then she is lost to us, Revan.",
      "nm41aacart03137_.mp3": "I just hope we're not too late. Bastila's been Malak's prisoner for a long time. If he turns her to the dark side she'll join him and the Sith will become invincible.",
      "nm41aastar03001_.mp3": "I can feel the power of the dark side emanating from that space station. It almost feels like... like it's alive. That must be where Malak has taken Bastila.",
      "nm41aastar03005_.mp3": "What was that? What's wrong? Did one of the Sith fighters hit us?",
      "nm41adguid01003_.mp3": "Wait... you can't go in there alone!",
      "nm41adguid01006_.mp3": "You might be walking into a trap... maybe Malak himself is waiting inside. Even if he isn't, that temple will be crawling with Dark Jedi. You'll need all the help you can get.",
      "nm41adguid01009_.mp3": "Your destiny - maybe the fate of the entire galaxy - could be forever changed inside that Temple. I'm not about to let you face that alone. Not after my premonition. There's a reason I had that vision.",
      "nm41adguid01011_.mp3": "So you just tell that guide of yours to do whatever he has to do to get us all inside the Temple.",
      "nm41adguid01014_.mp3": "I don't know what he said, but it sounds like your guide's being stubborn. We don't have time for this.",
      "nm41adguid01015_.mp3": "The Republic fleet is on the way and we're stuck on this planet until we deactivate that disruptor field. You have to convince him to get us inside that Temple!",
      "nm41adguid01020_.mp3": "Why do I get the feeling this is going to take a while? Still, we better stay ready. As soon as those shields go down we have to get inside the temple.",
      "nm41adguid01025_.mp3": "Not exactly the way I would have handled it, but given the circumstances it'll do.",
      "nm41adguid01027_.mp3": "I had a... a premonition. A vision through the Force. There's great danger inside that Temple. I can't let you face it alone.",
      "nm44acevil01030_.mp3": "Come on, Bastila. We have to escape before Malak shows up!",
      "nm44acevil01053_.mp3": "It's not to late for you, Bastila. The dark side is evil but it isn't all powerful. You can still fight against it. Don't let it consume you.",
      "nm44acevil01056_.mp3": "Listen to me... the dark side leads to death and destruction. I've seen the horrors the Sith have unleashed on the galaxy. Turn away from this path.",
      "nm44acevil01058_.mp3": "Don't do this, kid. I don't want to, but I'll fight you if I have to. Even if it costs me my life.",
      "nm44acevil01064_.mp3": "I'm a Jedi... I'll never bow down to the Sith. If you go through with this I have no choice but to do battle against you.",
      "nm44acevil01080_.mp3": "No! Don't give into your anger. Remain calm, remain focused. Don't let her twist your mind like this!",
      "nm44acexit03002_.mp3": "Hold on - you have to disable the energy shield around this Temple before we can leave. I saw a computer up here. It might be connected to the power generators of this place.",
      "nm44acexit03003_.mp3": "And if you don't disable the disruptor field protecting the Star Forge, the Ebon Hawk won't be able to leave the planet without crashing."

      "nglobebant00002_.mp3": "Fair enough. But I've seen you Jedi in action. There's no way those thugs would have stood a chance against your lightsaber.",
      "nglobebant00004_.mp3": "Wait a minute, let me get this straight. You *lost* your lightsaber? Ha-ha! I mean, isn't that a violation of some kind of Jedi code or something?",
      "nglobebant00009_.mp3": "Hey, hey, hey, don't get mad. I'm sorry. It's just funny to think of a legendary Jedi losing her lightsaber. Take my advice: this is one detail you might want to keep out of the history texts.",
      "nglobebant00011_.mp3": "Bastila, did you ever think about joining all the Jedi who were running off to follow Revan and Malak when they went to fight the Mandalorians?",
      "nglobebant00013_.mp3": "I guess. Still, do you ever wonder if things could have been different? Would Revan and Malak still have been corrupted if the Council had supported them instead of dragging its feet?",
      "nglobebant00017_.mp3": "So you're saying we should have done nothing? Just let the Mandalorians conquer us unopposed? I mean, the Republic was under attack, and the Order abandoned us!",
      "nglobebant00021_.mp3": "Yeah, right. And every single one of them would be speaking Mandalorain. I think we're done here. Let's just get back to the task at hand.",
      "nglobebant00024_.mp3": "I'll be honest, Mission, Taris would rate pretty low. The prejudice, the rich spoiling themselves while the poor are crushed beneath them - not a pretty picture.",
      "nglobebant00026_.mp3": "Trust me, Mission. There are a lot of worlds better than Taris. There are worse, too. But Taris is no place for a kid to live on her own - even a kid who's got a Wookiee to look out for her.",

      "nglobebant00036_.mp3": "Yeah, I know. And I'm sorry about what I said, too. I'm just a little on edge lately. Not surprising considering all we've been through. But I shouldn't take it out on you.",
      "nglobebant00038_.mp3": "Mission, you have to know that we don't think you're helpless. Look where we are, look at what we're doing. You're not just along for the ride.  We need you.",
      "nglobebant00040_.mp3": "Ah, it's no big deal. I know how it is. Sometimes you just need to hear a few words of encouragement. Kids are like that.",
      "nglobebant00044_.mp3": "I try not to think about my past battles too much. The horrors of war are something I'd rather not relive.",
      "nglobebant00048_.mp3": "I'm not a warrior, I'm a soldier. There's a difference. Warriors attack and conquer, they prey on the weak. Soldiers defend and protect the innocent - mostly from warriors.",
      "nglobebant00050_.mp3": "Justification through victory? So what happens when you lose? You know, like you did against us.",
      "nglobebant00052_.mp3": "Nice speech. I bet you tell yourself that every night so you can sleep. I don't want to talk about this anymore, Canderous. The war is over. You lost.",
      "nglobebant00102_.mp3": "So, Jolee, you decided to leave your little hermitage in the forest and come help us stop the Sith. I guess you realized this was worth coming out of retirement for, huh?",

      "nglobebant00109_.mp3": "That's an interesting theory, but I don't buy it. The Republic stands for something; it's stood for something for fifteen thousand years. And if it falls, everything will change forever.",
      "nglobecart04932_.mp3": "I'm no Jedi, but are you really supposed to be using the Force for things like this?",
      "nglobecart04933_.mp3": "Why did you do that? Sometimes... sometimes I just can't understand how you can be so cruel.",
      "nglobecart04935_.mp3": "That was totally uncalled for.",

      "nm01aacart01012_.mp3": "Bastila's escape pod's already gone, so there's no reason for us to stick around here and get shot by the Sith. Now come on - there'll be time for questions later!",

      "nm02aacarb01000_.mp3": "Bastila - you're alive! Finally, things are looking up. Now we just need to figure out a way to get off this planet.",
      "nm02aacarb01006_.mp3": "I know you're new at this, Bastila, but a leader doesn't berate her troops just because things aren't going as planned. Don't let your ego get in the way of the real issues here.",
      "nm02aacarb01012_.mp3": "Your talents might win us a few battles, but that doesn't make you a good leader! A good leader would at least listen to the advice of those who have seen more combat than she ever will!",
      "nm02aacarb01016_.mp3": "First off we can't get hung up on who's in charge; we all need to work together if we want to get off this rock. The answer's out there, we just have to find it.",
      "nm02aacarb01025_.mp3": "You know, I had my doubts about this mission but I figured the Jedi Council wouldn't put you in charge if you weren't prepared. But here you are, acting like a spoiled child!",
      "nm02aacart02000_.mp3": "Whoa, hold on. Don't try to get up yet. You were smashed up pretty bad when we crash landed here on Taris.",
      "nm02aacart02001_.mp3": " Don't worry, we should be safe here in this apartment. I gave you something to help you sleep. Just get some rest and let the kolto packs do their job. ",
      "nm02aacart02002_.mp3": "Good to see you up, instead of thrashing around in your sleep. You must have been having one hell of a nightmare. I was wondering if you were ever going to wake up.",
      "nm02aacart02003_.mp3": "I'm Carth, one of the Republic soldiers from the Endar Spire. I was with you on the escape pod, do you remember?",
      "nm02aacart02005_.mp3": "Well, you've been slipping in and out of consciousness for a couple of days now, so I imagine you're pretty confused about things. Try not to worry. We're safe... at least for the moment.",
      "nm02aacart02006_.mp3": "We're in an abandoned apartment on the planet of Taris. You were banged up pretty bad when our escape pod crashed, but luckily I wasn't seriously hurt.",
      "nm02aacart02007_.mp3": "I was able to drag you away from our crash site in all the confusion, and I stumbled onto this abandoned apartment. By the time the Sith arrived on the scene we were long gone.",
      "nm02aacart02010_.mp3": "You don't have to thank me. I've never abandoned anyone on a mission, and I'm not about to start now. Besides, I'm going to need your help. ",
      "nm02aacart02012_.mp3": "Taris is under Sith control. Their fleet is orbiting the planet, they've declared martial law and they've imposed a planet-wide quarantine. But I've been in worse spots.",
      "nm02aacart02013_.mp3": "I saw on your service records that you understand a remarkable number of alien languages. That's pretty rare in a raw recruit, but it should come in handy while we're stranded on a foreign world.",
      "nm02aacart02014_.mp3": "There's no way the Republic will be able to get anyone through the Sith blockade to help us. If we're going to find Bastila and get off this planet, we can't rely on anybody but ourselves.",
      "nm02aacart02016_.mp3": "That smack to your head did more damage than I thought. Bastila's a Jedi. She was with the strike team that killed Darth Revan, Malak's Sith master.",
      "nm02aacart02017_.mp3": "Bastila is the key to the whole Republic war effort. The Sith must have found out she was on the Endar Spire and set an ambush for us in this system.",
      "nm02aacart02018_.mp3": "I believe Bastila was on one of the escape pods that crashed down here on Taris. For the sake of the Republic war effort, we have to try and find her.",
      "nm02aacart02020_.mp3": "Bastila is no ordinary Jedi. She has a rare gift the Jedi call Battle Meditation. Bastila's power can influence entire armies. ",
      "nm02aacart02021_.mp3": "Through the Force Bastila can inspire her allies with confidence and make her enemies lose their will to fight. Often, that's all it takes to tip the balance in a battle.",
      "nm02aacart02022_.mp3": "Of course, there are limits to what she can do. But from what I understand of her ability, it requires great concentration and focus to maintain her Battle Meditation.",
      "nm02aacart02023_.mp3": "The attack on the Endar Spire happened so fast she never had a chance to use her Battle Meditation. Like us, she barely got out alive. ",
      "nm02aacart02026_.mp3": "Bastila's going to need our help. Many of Darth Malak's followers can use the dark side of the Force, and the Sith have already killed more than their share of Jedi in this war.",
      "nm02aacart02027_.mp3": "Nobody will be looking for a couple of common soldiers like us. And if we're careful we can move about the planet without attracting notice; a luxury Bastila won't have.",
      "nm02aacart02028_.mp3": "She's going to have half the Sith fleet looking for her. They know how important she is to the war effort.",
      "nm02aacart02030_.mp3": "Bastila's going to need our help. Many of Darth Malak's followers have mastered the dark side of the Force, and the Sith have already killed more than their share of Jedi in this war. ",
      "nm02aacart02031_.mp3": "I doubt anyone's specifically looking for us anymore: we're not that important. But if we're careful we can move about the planet without attracting notice; a luxury Bastila won't have.",
      "nm02aacart02032_.mp3": "She's going to have half the Sith fleet looking for her. They know how vital she is to the war effort.",
      "nm02aacart02033_.mp3": "Bastila is no ordinary Jedi. She has a rare gift the Jedi call Battle Meditation. Bastila's power can influence entire armies. ",
      "nm02aacart02035_.mp3": "Through the Force Bastila can inspire her allies with confidence and make her enemies lose their will to fight. And often, that's all it takes to tip the balance in a battle.",

      "nm02aacart02037_.mp3": "The attack on the Endar Spire happened so fast she probably never even had a chance to use her power. I'm guessing she barely got out alive, and now she's trapped here just as we are.",
      "nm02aacart02038_.mp3": "The whole planet is under quarantine. No ships can land or take-off. So if Bastila's going to escape Taris, she's going to need our help. And we'll probably need hers.",
      "nm02aacart02040_.mp3": "While you were out I did some scouting around. There are reports of a couple escape pods crashing down into the Undercity. That's probably a good place to start.",
      "nm02aacart02041_.mp3": "But the Undercity is a dangerous place. We don't want to go in there unprepared. It won't do Bastila any good if we go and get ourselves killed.",
      "nm02aacart02042_.mp3": "Taris is a pretty big place; luckily I found an old swoop droid to help us get around. I've got him sitting by the apartment door. Do you know how a swoop droid works?",
      "nm02aacart02044_.mp3": "Swoop droids are autopiloted land speeders. Through remote signals we can have them fly in to pick us up or drop us off at a location in a fraction of the time it would take to walk there.",
      "nm02aacart02045_.mp3": "The swoop can only operate in large, open locations. It can't take us down into the Undercity or inside a shop, but it could take us to a central location in the Upper or Lower City.",
      "nm02aacart02046_.mp3": "You can signal the swoop from the map screen of your datapad. It uses the map coordinates to plot its course, so if we haven't explored an area the swoop can't get the data to access it.",
      "nm02aacart02048_.mp3": "I've entered all the details on how to use the swoop droid into the electronic journal on your datapad if you want to check them out later.",
      "nm02aacart02050_.mp3": "I'll tell you whatever I can, though I...I don't know how much help it'll be. ",
      "nm02aacart02052_.mp3": "I understand why you want to know more about me; I...I kinda get the feeling we'll be spending a lot of time together over the next while.",
      "nm02aacart02053_.mp3": "But this isn't really the best time for long introductions; we should stay focused on the task at hand. There'll be time for that later.",
      "nm02aacart02055_.mp3": "Everything I know about Malak is pretty much common knowledge. He escaped the trap that killed Darth Revan, his Sith Master. With Revan's death, Malak became the new Dark Lord.",
      "nm02aacart02056_.mp3": "It's obvious that Malak's a ruthless tyrant who'll crush anyone who stands in his way... just like Revan was. Experience has shown that the Sith won't stop until the Republic lies in ruins.",
      "nm02aacart02057_.mp3": "Malak and his Sith don't respect anything except raw, brutal power. It's hard to imagine how someone who used to be a Jedi could become such a monster!",
      "nm02aacart02059_.mp3": "Malak and Revan were once both part of the Jedi Order, but they were young and headstrong. And against the wishes of the Council they went to battle the Mandalorians on the Outer Rim.",
      "nm02aacart02060_.mp3": "Something happened out there. Something corrupted them and drew them over to the dark side. Or maybe there was something rotten inside them all along. I don't know.",
      "nm02aacart02061_.mp3": "They formed an army of ex-Republic soldiers and Jedi who had fallen to the dark side, with Revan at their head... until Revan was killed by Bastila's Jedi strike team.",
      "nm02aacart02062_.mp3": "But even that didn't slow the Sith down. Malak just stepped in and assumed Revan's role. He took control of the Sith armada and resumed the bloody conquest of the Outer Worlds.",
      "nm02aacart02064_.mp3": "How can you say that? The Sith are butchers! Soldiers, civilians - I mean, they don't care who they kill! Even...even children!",
      "nm02aacart02065_.mp3": "Right now the Republic is the only thing keeping Malak's brutal fist from crushing the entire galaxy... and it won't be long until even the Republic falls to the Sith fleet.",
      "nm02aacart02067_.mp3": "I hope you're right. But the Republic hasn't been able to stop them so far, even with the support of the Jedi Council. I think Bastila might be the galaxy's last hope.",
      "nm02aacart02071_.mp3": "Taris was once a magnificent planet-wide metropolis of towering skyscrapers. But that was a long time ago.",
      "nm02aacart02072_.mp3": "The Upper City, where the rich citizens live, is...is still pretty safe. If it wasn't for the Sith occupation and the planet-wide quarantine it might not even be that bad a place to live.",
      "nm02aacart02073_.mp3": "But farther down things have degenerated. The...the Lower City is nothing but a slum overrun by swoop-bike gangs waging a never-ending war for control. And the Undercity is, well, even worse.",
      "nm02aacart02074_.mp3": "The lowest level of Taris is a wasteland overrun by rakghouls; mindless, diseased mutants that attack on sight. I've already entered all this info into your data-pad journal.",
      "nm02aacart02077_.mp3": "Good idea. We can use this abandoned apartment as a base, and we can probably get some equipment and supplies here in the Upper City. Just remember to keep a low profile. ",
      "nm02aacart02078_.mp3": "I've heard some grim stories about the Dark Jedi interrogation techniques. They say the Force can do terrible things to a mind. It can wipe away your memories and destroy your very identity!",
      "nm02aacart02079_.mp3": "But I figure if we don't do anything stupid we should be okay. I mean, after all, they're... they're looking for Bastila, not a couple of grunts like us. Alright, soldier, let's move out.",
      "nm02aacart02082_.mp3": "You mean besides a chance to get off this planet before the Sith find you? Do you...do you have any idea what the Sith do to prisoners of war?",
      "nm02aacart02084_.mp3": "Good. We need to work together if we're going to survive.",
      "nm02aacart02086_.mp3": "Oh, I get it. Never mind that the Sith will destroy the Republic and ravage the galaxy. You're only in this for the credits. ",
      "nm02aacart02087_.mp3": "Don't worry. The Republic pays its mercenaries well. You help me find Bastila and they'll make it more than worth your while, I'm sure. Plus, it might be your only chance to get off Taris.",
      "nm02aacart02089_.mp3": "Don't be a fool! You're not getting off this world without help, and you can't hide here forever. Do you have any idea what will happen when the Sith find you?",
      "nm02aacart02093_.mp3": "I don't. But Bastila's young, and she has a powerful command of the Force. We survived the crash landing, so I'm willing to bet that she may have, too.",
      "nm02aacart02094_.mp3": "Besides, what's the alternative? I mean, if she's dead, then no one can stop Malak and his Sith from wiping out the Republic. And I'd rather operate on the assumption that she survived.",
      "nm02aacart02096_.mp3": "I don't think you understand the situation. We can't hide on this planet forever. Eventually the Sith will find us... and, trust me, you don't want that.",
      "nm02aacart02097_.mp3": "Getting off this world isn't going to be easy... we'll probably need Bastila's help. Not to mention that without her, the whole Republic war effort is doomed.",
      "nm02aacart02101_.mp3": "I'm not surprised. You took a serious blow to the head. You're probably having all kinds of strange dreams. I wouldn't worry too much about it.",
      "nm02aadia004066_.mp3": "What's wrong with you? She doesn't deserve this!",
      "nm02aajani05016_.mp3": "There's no need to antagonize the man. Besides... do you want to live in filth? I sure don't.",
      "nm02aalarr06024_.mp3": "Look, I know we're trying to keep a low profile but this kind of attitude will draw attention we don't need.",
      "nm02aalarr99029_.mp3": "And I can tell you from experience that they aren't any good at all against a simple vibroblade. That's why the Republic has been training soldiers in hand-to-hand and melee combat.",
      "nm02abbull02010_.mp3": "You're giving him a hundred credits? Generous.",
      "nm02abbull02018_.mp3": "Are you joking? We don't need this guy's credits. Just go on, we were happy to help.",
      "nm02abdrun05010_.mp3": "Well, this is rich.",
      "nm02abdrun05032_.mp3": "Oh, great. We're fighting the drunks, are we? Man, do they stink.",
      "nm02abgort09042_.mp3": "Come on. We should keep moving. Kook or no, people like him can make trouble for us.",
      "nm02abithb10020_.mp3": "Hey, aren't you...? Hey, hey stop that, you kids! Leave him alone!",
      "nm02abithb10035_.mp3": "Well, I will. You kids... get lost before I kick your sorry butts! Now, now beat it!!",
      "nm02abjani11121_.mp3": "You'd think people would be a little more tolerant of others in this day and age. *sigh* I guess stupidity and ignorance will never go out of style.",
      "nm02absith18022_.mp3": "*whispers* We're going to need some kind of disguise if we want to get past this guy.",
      "nm02acboun01030_.mp3": "*whisper* I know we have to be careful about drawing attention to ourselves, but are we just going to let them drag this guy off?",
      "nm02acgurn03035_.mp3": "If you haven't noticed, not much about this place is fair.",
      "nm02acgurn03037_.mp3": "That doesn't mean we have to actively work to make it worse, Carth.",
      "nm02acgurn03039_.mp3": "We're not in a position to be much more than just realists, are we?",
      "nm02acgurn03051_.mp3": "And then only the rich could afford the cure. Just let the poor suffer, right?",
      "nm02ackebl04042_.mp3": "Hmm. I've heard of the Exchange. Bad organization to cross. If anyone has blockade-breaking ships, however, it's them.",
      "nm02ackebl04070_.mp3": "Mostly? What do you mean by that?",
      "nm02aczelk11006_.mp3": "Well, for that you have my thanks. It's good to know that at least some of these men ended up in compassionate hands.",
      "nm02aczelk11018_.mp3": "No, it's *not*. The Sith would torture these men, or worse. You're not threatening this man while I'm present.",
      "nm02aczelk11026_.mp3": "I understand some extra credits might help us in our mission, but I don't approve of your methods. Zelka's a good man... you shouldn't have done that.",
      "nm02aczelk11184_.mp3": "So you twisted a few extra credits out of him. Hope it was worth it.",
      "nm02adalie03006_.mp3": "What are you doing? There's no need to go around drawing attention to ourselves. You there... just get out of here.",
      "nm02adsarn07036_.mp3": "You've got to expect at least a little risk if you want some credits, don't you?",
      "nm02adsarn07053_.mp3": "Sounds like this could work. Mind you, do we really have another choice?",
      "nm02adscar09039_.mp3": "Wow, that was sure generous of you. I just hope we don't end up needing those credits later on.",
      "nm02adscar09040_.mp3": "I know we might need credits, but there has got to be a better way to get them than this!",
      "nm02adsith10057_.mp3": "*whisper* I know all about Sith interrogations. This isn't going to end well.",
      "nm02adyung12049_.mp3": "Sounds like this could work. Not like we have much choice in the matter though, do we?",
      "nm02aebend03033_.mp3": "You sure you want to get involved in this? Seems a bit pointless to me. Up to you.",
      "nm02aecand30008_.mp3": "Careful. Mercs like this haven't a lick of conscience... they'll betray you in a heartbeat. This could be a trap.",
      "nm02aecand30039_.mp3": "Well, That's... it's not a bad plan. It might just work.",
      "nm02aecand30060_.mp3": "Hmm. Much as I hate to say it, he's probably right. We're going to need that ship.",
      "nm02aeduel12121_.mp3": "Vibroblades and blasters? And nobody ever dies? How come I get the feeling you're trying to take us for a ride?",
      "nm02aeduel12122_.mp3": "This is for the best. We could use the credits from these duels, but using your real name is too risky. The Sith might have come across a crew manifest back on the Endar Spire.",
      "nm02aegana14022_.mp3": "*whisper* Careful what you say. I get the feeling this spoiled brat could cause us more trouble than she's worth.",
      "nm03aacand05010_.mp3": "Careful. Mercs like this haven't a lick of conscience... they'll betray you in a heartbeat. This could be a trap.",
      "nm03aacand05038_.mp3": "That's... not a bad plan. It might just work.",
      "nm03aacand05053_.mp3": "Hmm. Much as I hate to say it, he's probably right. We're going to need that ship.",
      "nm03aakand01004_.mp3": "And when we win the race, we get Bastila, right?",
      "nm03aakand01009_.mp3": "Explode? Are you crazy? Why would we risk riding that thing, then?",
      "nm03aakand01025_.mp3": "You're talking like Brejik didn't steal that engine, himself, to begin with!",
      "nm03aakand01050_.mp3": "Are you sure about this? I want to get Bastila back... but taking contracts to kill people is a bit much. Even if it is just more biker scum.",
      "nm03admatr99075_.mp3": "Hold on a second. I want to hear what he means by 'clear conscience'.",
      "nm03aecand06008_.mp3": "Careful. Mercs like this haven't a lick of conscience... they'll betray you in a heartbeat. This could be a trap.",
      "nm03aecand06039_.mp3": "That's... not a bad plan. It might just work.",
      "nm03aecand06060_.mp3": "Hmm. Much as I hate to say it, he's...he's probably right. We're going to need that ship.",
      "nm03aehold13087_.mp3": "Yeah, right. Sounds to me like she was defending herself.",
      "nm03aemiss14037_.mp3": "So we noticed. Still, you seem like an odd pair.",
      "nm03aemiss14074_.mp3": "You showed a lot of guts dealing with those Vulkars, kid. You got a name?",
      "nm03ae_zax22086_.mp3": "It couldn't hurt, could it? Enough credits could help grease a lot of wheels.",
      "nm03ae_zax22090_.mp3": "Well, it's my experience that the targets of these bounties are usually criminals, themselves. So don't get all in a twist over it.",
      "nm03ae_zax22195_.mp3": "I can't see anything wrong with getting rid of people like that - as long as we don't end up on the list of their victims.",
      "nm03ae_zax22196_.mp3": "Okay, I don't know about Davik's special contracts. Justice is one thing, but doing a crime lord's dirty work is something else.",
      "nm04aagend05047_.mp3": "No offense, but I can see why people normally avoid this place.",
      "nm04aaigea07074_.mp3": "I get the feeling if it wasn't for Gendar, this place would be a lot worse off than it is.",
      "nm04aaigea07075_.mp3": "Watch yourself. There's something slimy about this guy. I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw him.",
      "nm04aamiss10026_.mp3": "Do you know where he's being kept?",
      "nm04aamiss10038_.mp3": "I guess with a Wookiee at your side you've got to figure you can handle the odd rakghoul attack.",
      "nm04aamiss10039_.mp3": "Hold on a second. Don't just brush her off like this; Gadon said this girl's the only one who can get us inside the Bek base.",
      "nm04aaoutm14060_.mp3": "I don't believe this planet! Even the beggars are trying to shake us down.",
      "nm04aaoutm14062_.mp3": "I'm sure you are, miss. It's just too bad your little welcoming committee is there to give people a bad first impression.",
      "nm04aaoutw23039_.mp3": "So you just lock them away in a cage?",
      "nm04aaruki25053_.mp3": "Be careful... this one might be crazy enough to be dangerous.",
      "nm04aaruki25151_.mp3": "From what I've seen of Taris, it doesn't look like much has changed. Except for the Upper City, people here are just as bad off as the poor in your little history.",
      "nm04aaruki25152_.mp3": "Sounds like a myth to me. Something to give the people here some false hope to cling to so they don't go mad with despair.",
      "nm08aadavs10019_.mp3": "There's no need to threaten these poor women. It's not their fault their life is like this.",
      "nm08aadavs10044_.mp3": "Umm... not to interrupt your fun, but we do have to get underway...",
      "nm08aadavs11036_.mp3": "Come on. I mean... I love a massage as much as the next guy, but we're not exactly on vacation here. We need to get going.",
      "nm08aahudr11013_.mp3": "We should go now. We got what we needed.",
      "nm08aahudr11020_.mp3": "Hey! There's no need for that. Just... just run, pal, before my friend here decides to start blasting.",
      "nm08aahudr11043_.mp3": "We may need that ship. Are you sure we shouldn't free him?",
      "nm10aavulk05004_.mp3": "Why? What's up on the second level?",
      "nm10aavulk05012_.mp3": "You...you don't think he could be of help? I mean, why kill him?",
      "nm10aavulk05016_.mp3": "Well, not that I object, really. I just... I'd rather not throw aside anything that could help us right now.",
      "nm10aavulk05032_.mp3": "Wait, now... we, we could probably use this guy, don't you think?",
      "nm10aavulk05035_.mp3": "Okay, you hear that, scum? You get a reprieve. Now give us some information to make it worth it.",
      "nm10aawait07013_.mp3": "You may know more than you think, miss. Help us and we'll help you, okay?",
      "nm10aawait07029_.mp3": "No, no wait. This girl is no threat to us. Just run along, miss, and get out of here. And do it quickly before the Vulkars come back.",
      "nm10abvulk08012_.mp3": "Th...that's us. New lab techs. You're a perceptive one.",
      "nm10ackand01006_.mp3": "And when we win the race, we get Bastila, right?",
      "nm10ackand01013_.mp3": "Explode? Are...are you crazy? Why would we risk riding that thing, then?",
      "nm10ackand01038_.mp3": "You're talking like Brejik didn't steal that engine, himself, to begin with!",
      "nm10ackand01079_.mp3": "Are you sure about this? I mean, I want to get Bastila back... but taking contracts to kill people is a bit much. Even if it is just more biker scum.",
      "nm11aagado02010_.mp3": "Don't fool yourself. The Sith would never commit to that kind of operation. They'd... they'd probably do something much more grand and deadly.",
      "nm11aagado02038_.mp3": "So how do you propose we go about rescuing Bastila, then? We can't fight all the gangs.",
      "nm11aagado02101_.mp3": "Uh, very tactful. Are you itching for a fight or something?",
      "nm11aagado02173_.mp3": "They still think Bastila is just a Republic Officer. That could work to our advantage. Maybe she'll even figure out a way to escape from the Vulkar base on her own.",
      "nm11aazaer09030_.mp3": "Gadon sounds like the kind of person who you'd want in charge down here. At least to me.",
      "nm12aabast01001_.mp3": "Safe? You saw what his fleet did to Taris: there wasn't a building over two stories high left standing! They...they turned the planet into one big pile of rubble.",
      "nm12aabast01005_.mp3": "Maybe you're right. It isn't easy to witness the annihilation of an entire planet. I know Mission must be taking it pretty hard.",
      "nm12aac02001001_.mp3": "Sith Interdictor ship. They must have been waiting for us on the hyperspace route. We're caught in their tractor beam.",
      "nm12aac02001003_.mp3": "It's the Leviathan. Saul Karath's vessel. My old mentor.",
      "nm12aac03001000_.mp3": "The Star Forge... I've never seen anything like it.",
      "nm12aac03001001_.mp3": "I'm transmitting these coordinates to Admiral Dodonna.  Maybe a quick strike by the Republic can cripple the Sith fleet.",
      "nm12aac03001002_.mp3": "Message is away. Now we can just wait for the Republic to show up. We should be safe here - we're outside their sensor range.",
      "nm12aac03001004_.mp3": "A small vanguard of Sith fighters, coming in hard!  Someone needs to get on those gun turrets. ## Take those fighters out before they report our position to the main fleet!\n",
      "nm12aac04001000_.mp3": "We've got problems! We've flown into some kind of disruptor field. All my instruments are jammed! We've got massive overloads in all systems!",
      "nm12aac04001001_.mp3": "I'm picking up a single planet in this system.  I'll try and put us down there.  Hold on.",
      "nm12aac05001000_.mp3": "The Republic Fleet must have got the message I sent as we were crashing onto that planet. I'm picking up a transmission from them now.",
      "nm12aac05001002_.mp3": "Admiral Dodonna, this is Carth Onasi. We are receiving your transmission.",
      "nm12aac05001004_.mp3": "The Star Forge wasn't constructed by the Sith, Admiral. We don't have time for me to fully explain it, but that space station is far older than you can imagine.",
      "nm12aac05001006_.mp3": "You can't do that, Admiral.  The Star Forge is a factory of immense power.  It's been churning out the capital ships, snub fighters and assault droids that have powered the Sith war effort. ## You have to destroy the Star Forge now or you'll be fighting an unending wave of reinforcements.",
      "nm12aac05001011_.mp3": "It's because of Bastila, Admiral.  She turned to the dark side and become Malak's apprentice. ## We suspect she's somewhere on that space station right now, ## using her Battle Meditation against you and your fleet.",
      "nm12aac05001021_.mp3": "Don't worry, Admiral. The Ebon Hawk and her crew are going to see this through to the end!",
      "nm12aacuts01001_.mp3": "Incoming fighters!",
      "nm12aastar03000_.mp3": "The Star Forge... it's huge. I've never seen anything like it before.",
      "nm12aastar03002_.mp3": "I'm transmitting these co-ordinates to Admiral Dodonna. Maybe a quick strike by the Republic can cripple the Sith fleet. ",
      "nm12aastar03003_.mp3": "Message is away. We should probably wait for the Republic fleet to show up before we try and rescue Bastila. We'll need cover if we want to fly in and dock on the Star Forge.",
      "nm12aastar03004_.mp3": "We've got company... a small vanguard of Sith fighters, coming in hard! Get on those gun turrets! Take those fighters out before they report our position to the main fleet!",

      "nm12aastar03007_.mp3": "I'm picking up a single planet in this system. I'll try and put us down here. Hold on - this may be a rough landing.",
      "nm13aaahla03013_.mp3": "Not to mention that I wouldn't mind getting out of this enclave for a bit. I mean, come on, how bad could it be?",
      "nm13aabast01006_.mp3": "This looks like a door... but I don't see any way to open it",
      "nm13aabast01022_.mp3": "An audience with the Jedi Council? That's pretty unusual for someone who isn't even a Jedi. What's this about, Bastila?",
      "nm13aabast01026_.mp3": "Well, I don't like being left out of the loop, but I'm not looking to get you in any trouble with the Jedi Masters. We'll do things your way for a while.",
      "nm13aacart02000_.mp3": "Dantooine looks peaceful enough, but packs of kath hounds roam these plains. We need to keep our guard up while we're out here.",
      "nm13aacart02002_.mp3": "Patrol droids - they may be programmed to attack on sight!",
      "nm13aacart02004_.mp3": "This morning's getting stranger by the minute. First Bastila comes out looking like she saw a ghost, and now you.",
      "nm13aacart02006_.mp3": "Well, Bastila did mention that you should go to the Council chambers before she left. It is no doubt urgent, so you shouldn't keep them waiting.",
      "nm13aacart02008_.mp3": "No, she didn't. She didn't seem well, as I recall... and for that matter neither do you. Are you alright?",
      "nm13aacart02012_.mp3": "Well, I can't say I blame you. I... I haven't exactly been sleeping well myself. Here I thought things would get better once we escaped Taris.",
      "nm13aacart02014_.mp3": "You got it.",
      "nm13aacart02016_.mp3": "They're waiting for you inside.",
      "nm13aacrat07088_.mp3": "I'm not an expert on the Jedi, but this seems like the kind of thing that could get a person into a lot of trouble.",
      "nm13aajuha11026_.mp3": "First the Jedi trick you into becoming an enemy, then they welcome you back as a friend. I can't say I approve of their training methods.",
      "nm13aashen16004_.mp3": "I wish you the best of luck, Shen. I hope you two find the happiness I once knew myself.",
      "nm13aavand17310_.mp3": "*whisper* It's obvious he doesn't believe you. He must have some reason for letting you get away with this lie. I swear, I'll never understand these Jedi.",
      "nm14aaelis04038_.mp3": "Wow. She really misses her droid, doesn't she?",
      "nm14aaelis09008_.mp3": "I don't think I've ever felt so bad for a droid before.",
      "nm14aajon006024_.mp3": "Is that an impersonation of Bastila? If it is, it's a good one.",
      "nm14aajon006026_.mp3": "And? What's your point?",
      "nm14aajon006031_.mp3": "I say we look for these Mandalorians. I fought them in the war... they're nothing but vicious pirates. We should... we should stop them if we can.",
      "nm14abahla01005_.mp3": "Somehow I imagine the story from the Sandrals would sound just about the same, don't you?",
      "nm14abahla01028_.mp3": "You would be willing to risk open war over this?",
      "nm14abahla01030_.mp3": "And here I thought you would blame us, if we failed. It seems everyone is responsible for your actions except for you.",
      "nm14abahla01033_.mp3": "What can I say? You pick up a few things.",
      "nm14abahla01050_.mp3": "I've seen men like Ahlan Matale before. He's so convinced that his hatred is justified he's prepared to do anything. And if we don't intervene, there will be war.",
      "nm14abmdro03007_.mp3": "These settlers have come to Dantooine seeking privacy. Perhaps we should respect their wishes.",
      "nm14acbolo01023_.mp3": "Heh heh... that's sort of funny, but you should really be serious about this, no?",
      "nm14acbolo01346_.mp3": "You did good. You might just make a proper Jedi yet, who knows?",
      "nm14acbolo01351_.mp3": "Maybe he thought he was shooting Calder?",
      "nm14adcuts02362_.mp3": "What are you doing? Are trying to get everyone here killed?",
      "nm15aabast02014_.mp3": "That sounds like quite a supposition. What if you're wrong?",
      "nm16aanuri01014_.mp3": "That's quite a line. You actually believe that? Don't you think someone is allowed to value privacy?",
      "nm16aanuri01018_.mp3": "Actually, it is. All I'm saying is that not everybody welcomes the sight of a Jedi with open arms. Better get used to it.",
      "nm16aanuri01020_.mp3": "I've seen an evasion or two in my time... enough to know when I hear it.",
      "nm16aanuri01058_.mp3": "This man just lost his son! I can't believe you're trying to squeeze extra credits out of him.",
      "nm16aaraha02010_.mp3": "You don't think that perhaps there's more to look at here, do you? That maybe everything isn't what it appears?",
      "nm16aaraha02036_.mp3": "Yeah, that's the way to go about it. Make things worse for these people, why don't you?",
      "nm17aa03sh01059_.mp3": "Why did you do that?! It's not like we're badly in need of credits, for crying out loud.",
      "nm17aa03sh01117_.mp3": "No justice. Makes you wonder sometimes if the Republic even exists at all, out here.",
      "nm17aa03sh01160_.mp3": "This isn't right! We should be helping people, not making their lives miserable.",
      "nm17aa03sh01164_.mp3": "I'm glad to see we're still the good guys here. Sometimes I think we forget that.",
      "nm17aa11iz05063_.mp3": "Leader of our tribe? Heh. That's a new one.",
      "nm17aa11iz05104_.mp3": "Hmm. I wonder just how long ago the little fella is talking, here?",
      "nm17aa11iz05116_.mp3": "What. You're joking, right? Just because he's small doesn't mean he's any more trustworthy than a Gamorrean, Bastila. Don't be naive.",
      "nm17aa11iz05120_.mp3": "Well, you might have pointed that out in the first place. Jedi senses I trust. Wishful thinking I don't.",
      "nm17aaiziz99152_.mp3": "I know Jawas don't have the best reputation, but that doesn't mean we can just treat them like this!",
      "nm17ac08hk01079_.mp3": "Droid like this usually doesn't have former owners that survived, it would be my guess.",
      "nm17ac08yu02017_.mp3": "Sounds like you've got a faulty droid on your hands.",
      "nm17ac08yu02075_.mp3": "And was this a droid of his own... or something stored in that warehouse?",
      "nm17ad03gu03016_.mp3": "Hey, don't push your luck, fellas.",
      "nm17ad03gu03051_.mp3": "There's only one language you Gamorreans ever understand. A blaster to your forehead.",
      "nm17ad03ta06014_.mp3": "Hey! You talk to her with a bit of respect in your voice or you'll end this conversation minus a few teeth! Got it?",
      "nm17ae04ce02099_.mp3": "Right. Tell me why we're talking to this guy again?",
      "nm17ae04ce02108_.mp3": "I'm sure they wouldn't mind *some* of the credits, as opposed to getting it stolen out of their pockets.",
      "nm17ae04ga03063_.mp3": "Maybe we should spend less time shaking people down for credits and more time on finding a way to stop the Sith.",
      "nm17ae04ni04009_.mp3": "I'm impressed, helping a kid like Nico off to a decent start. Good job.",
      "nm17ae04ni04106_.mp3": "That Hutt's going to suck every credit he can out of that kid, then toss him aside. Might as well have sold him to slavers.",
      "nm17af07ja05010_.mp3": "Hence the 'unclear' part. Or did you miss that?",
      "nm17af07ja05023_.mp3": "Hmm. These Jawas sure aren't the trusting type, are they?",
      "nm17af07ja05027_.mp3": "Well, for once, I'll agree with you.",
      "nm17ag10cz01175_.mp3": "*whisper* I don't know much about the Jedi code, but I know I'd rather see those credits in our hands than in the hands of Czerka Corp or the Sith.",
      "nm18ab10ta05019_.mp3": "*sigh* I guess we should help him out.",
      "nm18ackoma99135_.mp3": "There's an unwritten code of loyalty. You just don't turn on your allies like this. Any good soldier would tell you that.",
      "nm18acstar99000_.mp3": "Anyone else get the feeling that finding this Star Map in the back of this krayt dragon's cave is more than just a coincidence?",
      "nm18acstar99007_.mp3": "We should probably get going now. We've found the Star Map, and I'm guessing there isn't much else worth seeing on this planet.",
      "nm22aadaso07060_.mp3": "I have to admit, I'm surprised you let him get away. I don't know if I could have been as forgiving.",
      "nm22aaelix08042_.mp3": "No business sense? You mean they don't like to be cheated out of all their belongings and freedom.",
      "nm22aaelix08057_.mp3": "No, they're not. An honest man is pretty scarce, too, wouldn't you say?",
      "nm22aajano06095_.mp3": "Humane, you call it? Beneficial? Sounds like a bunch of excuses, if you ask me.",
      "nm22aajano06097_.mp3": "Are you saying you approve of this?!",
      "nm22aajano06111_.mp3": "Odd energy signatures? Have you ever checked those out?",
      "nm22aazaal01036_.mp3": "The Wookiee was looking pretty agitated back in the ship. You think it's wise to leave him unattended?",
      "nm22aazaal01038_.mp3": "He looked like there was something he needed to do. Besides, we don't know this planet. He could prove useful. ",
      "nm22aazaal01040_.mp3": "Good or bad, he's got to have some interest in Kashyyyk. I'd rather have him with us.",
      "nm22aazaal01042_.mp3": "I agree, but he could prove useful. He'd certainly know the place. And I wouldn't mind keeping an eye on him.",
      "nm22abchor02044_.mp3": "Why not do something about it, then?",
      "nm22abdehn06018_.mp3": "Put it down? You killed him, you mean.",
      "nm22abdehn06111_.mp3": "It's a good thing Zaalbar isn't here to see this. I doubt he'd approve of what you're doing. Actually, I don't know if I approve, either.",
      "nm22abzaal01026_.mp3": "This planet is incredible! It's too bad Zaalbar isn't with us. It would be nice to have a guide who's familiar with this place.",
      "nm23acworr01078_.mp3": "Good thinking. Jaarak doesn't strike me as the type to murder for no reason.",
      "nm23adchuu01143_.mp3": "Are you going to second-guess everyone?",
      "nm23adchuu01250_.mp3": "I don't like leaving someone behind, but I guess we don't have a choice.",
      "nm23adfrey02070_.mp3": "Careful. He'll be impossible to reason with if you get him any madder.",
      "nm23adfrey02087_.mp3": "Now you've done it. There's no way you could convince him of that.",
      "nm24aapgen07053_.mp3": "We're under attack! ",
      "nm25aacomp01255_.mp3": "You mean you'd just let all those people die? That's monstrous!",
      "nm25aastar99000_.mp3": "This doesn't make any sense. Why put a Star Map here in the Shadowlands? Who's ever going to see it?",
      "nm25aastar99007_.mp3": "I suppose it's possible the Star Map was built before these trees were ever here. It's just hard to imagine this world without these massive forests.",
      "nm25aastar99028_.mp3": "You know what? This place is making me uneasy. We've got the Star Map, let's just get out of here.",
      "nm26aairim06025_.mp3": "What then? What happened to the youths?",
      "nm26aanilk09037_.mp3": "I'm uncomfortable with spying on the Republic... but if we could assure the Selkath that they mean no harm, then perhaps it might be worth it.",
      "nm26aanilk09041_.mp3": "If the Republic did mean harm to the Selkath, then I want to know what the Selkath did to provoke it.",
      "nm26aanilk09068_.mp3": "The Hrakert Rift is the source of kolto? Why would the Republic risk so much to send troops there? I don't get it.",
      "nm26aaselj17008_.mp3": "Speaking of that injury, has it been taken into consideration, your honor?",
      "nm26aaselj17010_.mp3": "Well, speaking of that injury... does that not make it seem unlikely that he killed anyone?",
      "nm26aaselj17064_.mp3": "We'll do our best. You can count on that.",
      "nm26aaselj18014_.mp3": "The Republic believes in justice, as do you. We just want Sunry to be fairly treated, that's all.",
      "nm26aaselj21034_.mp3": "Hey! I thought you Selkath judges were supposed to follow the law! You can't already have decided that Sunry is guilty!",
      "nm26aaselj21038_.mp3": "That's a stupid law for any civilized world to have.",
      "nm26aasunr26058_.mp3": "You're talking about acts of war. We're just defending ourselves! You murdered your girlfriend in her sleep.",
      "nm26aasunr26068_.mp3": "I hate to say it, but he has a point. The Republic needs that kolto.",
      "nm26aasunr26070_.mp3": "If need be. We are talking about a Sith, remember? I don't approve of what he did any more than you --",
      "nm26aasunr26072_.mp3": "The Republic's principles aren't worth a hill of beans if it falls, Bastila. I'll do whatever I can to save it.",
      "nm26aatria27515_.mp3": "I... I don't believe this. Sunry should be remembered as a hero, not as a murderer. This isn't right.",
      "nm26aatria27519_.mp3": "I knew you wouldn't let the Republic down!",
      "nm26acignu04081_.mp3": "Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean, I want to help get Sunry acquitted, but what if the Selkath find out about this?",
      "nm27aashas06030_.mp3": "Well, great! It can't be that hard to find proof of the Sith's activities... can it?",
      "nm27aashas06038_.mp3": "[Persuade] Spoken like a true Sith. They wouldn't wait for proof either, I'm sure.",
      "nm27aashas06106_.mp3": "*whisper* How could you say something like that? What's gotten into you?",
      "nm28aamerc03041_.mp3": "Then how are we supposed to get you out of here?",
      "nm33aacart04660_.mp3": "I know. Don't worry about it. I just... must not be making much sense.",
      "nm33aacart04661_.mp3": "I know that. I'm not angry at you... don't think that. I must not be making much sense.",
      "nm33aacart04662_.mp3": "You probably mean well with your questions. I'm just not accustomed to talking about my past very much. At all, actually.",
      "nm33aacart04663_.mp3": "You're the one who wanted to know more about me. Well this is it, this is what I am.",
      "nm33aacart04664_.mp3": "I guess I did say you could ask me questions later, didn't I? Is this really necessary?",
      "nm33aacart04666_.mp3": "No. No, I don't have a problem with it, really. Go ahead and interrogate me.",
      "nm33aacart04668_.mp3": "Oh. Well, if it's an interrogation you wanted, why didn't you say so?",
      "nm33aacart04670_.mp3": "Oh no, how can I resist a challenge to my manly pride, huh? Ha ha! Fine, you've made your point. Interrogate at will.",
      "nm33aacart04672_.mp3": "No, I was just joking, though you do seem to be full of questions. It's rather refreshing, to be honest.",
      "nm33aacart04674_.mp3": "I don't get testy. I get angry. And if I was angry, you wouldn't have to ask me if I was, let me assure you.",
      "nm33aacart04676_.mp3": "All my secrets are purely of the mundane variety, unfortunately. Nothing worth extracting, though you're welcome to try.",
      "nm33aacart04677_.mp3": "Let me ask you something first, though. I've been going through the battle aboard the Endar Spire over and over in my head since we crashed.",
      "nm33aacart04678_.mp3": "Some things just don't add up for me. Maybe you could tell me what happened... from your perspective.",
      "nm33aacart04680_.mp3": "Look... it has nothing to do with you, personally. I don't trust anyone, and I have my reasons.",
      "nm33aacart04681_.mp3": "And, no, I'm not going to discuss them. So can we just keep our mind on more important things?",
      "nm33aacart04684_.mp3": "Alright, alright. You must be the most damned persistent woman I've ever met.",
      "nm33aacart04685_.mp3": "Alright, Alright. You're pretty damned tenacious, you know that?",
      "nm33aacart04686_.mp3": "We'll talk about it... but later. Right now I just want to get going.",
      "nm33aacart04688_.mp3": "Good. Like I said before, I prefer action to talk, anyway.",
      "nm33aacart04690_.mp3": "You're probably one of the most skilled women I've ever met. You've saved my butt more than once and I'm lucky you're here to help me, no question.",
      "nm33aacart04692_.mp3": "Is that your idea of an insult? Come on, sister, take your best shot.",
      "nm33aacart04694_.mp3": "Oh, ouch. I think you hurt my man-feelings with that one.",
      "nm33aacart04696_.mp3": "I guess I did. Feel better now?",
      "nm33aacart04698_.mp3": "Good. Then maybe we can talk reasonably about this.",
      "nm33aacart04700_.mp3": "*Sigh* Look... all I mean is that if you're smart, you won't trust anyone... not me, not Bastila and especially not yourself.",
      "nm33aacart04711_.mp3": "And I don't need all these questions. What I do need is to try and save the galaxy, if that's even possible.",
      "nm33aacart04712_.mp3": "Why is whether or not I trust you or anyone so damned important to you? Why... why do you even care?",
      "nm33aacart04713_.mp3": "We don't have time for this, so can we please just... drop it. For now? Can we pick it up later if you really must, I... want to get underway.",
      "nm33aacart04715_.mp3": "It's not what I want. I have a duty and I intend to see it through. The galaxy's in danger and I want to save it... that's what I want!",
      "nm33aacart04717_.mp3": "No, I don't want to talk about it. What I want is to save the galaxy... if that's even possible.",
      "nm33aacart04720_.mp3": "I don't need to be analyzed, thanks. Can we just get back to business?",
      "nm33aacart04722_.mp3": "Not all of us have the luxury of a choice. I'm conditioned this way, sorry.",
      "nm33aacart04724_.mp3": "I would be more than happy to, but she's as close-mouthed as the rest of the Council. I'm hoping you'll be the one to enlighten me.",
      "nm33aacart04725_.mp3": "I'm not trying to provoke you or imply that you're somehow responsible for the Jedi Council... but give me a hand, here! There has to be a reason!",
      "nm33aacart04726_.mp3": "No, I don't... I didn't mean that you weren't wanted, or that I want to go! It's just... damn it!",
      "nm33aacart04727_.mp3": "Look, I didn't mean it that way. I want to get to Saul, not... no... no, forget it. It seems all I can do is insult you, isn't it?",
      "nm33aacart04728_.mp3": "Just forget I said anything. Let's... let's... just get on with what we were doing.",
      "nm33aalash11005_.mp3": "Great, just what we needed. Some punks come to steal our lunch credits.",
      "nm33aalash11014_.mp3": "Ah, you don't think they're a bit pre-provoked to begin with?",
      "nm33aalash11039_.mp3": "Cute. Maybe you should try juggling next time.",
      "nm33aalash11066_.mp3": "Is this a raffle? How many guesses do we get?",
      "nm33aalash11079_.mp3": "Is this a raffle? How many guesses do we get?",
      "nm33aapros17027_.mp3": "Too bad that's exactly where we're headed.",
      "nm33aapros18028_.mp3": "Well, too bad that's exactly where we're headed.",
      "nm33aashaa19016_.mp3": "Oh, this is rich.",
      "nm33aasith20008_.mp3": "Yeah, it does. Okay, you're off the hook. Let's go, guys.",
      "nm33aasith20011_.mp3": "Hey! Good plan!",
      "nm33aasith20015_.mp3": "Ahhh, alright. Let's go. Consider yourself lucky, stranger.",
      "nm33aasith20022_.mp3": "What?! You... you won't get away with this!!",
      "nm33aasith20025_.mp3": "That's pretty funny. Why should we be scared of you?",
      "nm33aasith20033_.mp3": "Yeah, okay. Just keep out of our way next time, you.",
      "nm33abacad01008_.mp3": "No more disruptive than our 'master' will be.",
      "nm33abacad01011_.mp3": "Hey!",
      "nm33abacad01012_.mp3": "Oh, nothing.",
      "nm33abcart04782_.mp3": "I just can't believe he's dead. I... you should have stopped him! You should have done something to prevent this!",
      "nm33abcart04784_.mp3": "Oh, don't give me that innocent look! You can talk a Hutt out of his credits, you could have found a way... you could have saved him!",
      "nm33abcart04786_.mp3": "He was my son!!",
      "nm33abcart04787_.mp3": "I... I wish we hadn't come. I wish I'd never found him.",
      "nm33abcart04789_.mp3": "I'm sorry, too. And I'm sorry I ever met you.",
      "nm33abcart04790_.mp3": "I... no, I didn't mean that. Please... maybe it would be better if we continued with the mission. I want to... take my mind off this.",
      "nm33abcart04791_.mp3": "Saving the galaxy is what's important now. My son... I can mourn my son later. When we're done. So... let's just go.",
      "nm33abcart04793_.mp3": "No, I did fail him. And so did you. I wish I'd never met you.",
      "nm33abcart04795_.mp3": "No. If it did, I would never have met you.",
      "nm33abcart04797_.mp3": "Is it? You seem just fine at pulling off the near-impossible... when you want to.",
      "nm33abcart04798_.mp3": "I can't help but wonder if part of you didn't enjoy this. I thought we might be friends, but with you... heh, who can tell?",
      "nm33abcart04800_.mp3": "Is it? I find it hard to tell which side you're on, sometimes. Still... not all the blame is yours. Most of it is mine.",
      "nm33abcart04802_.mp3": "No, I see that. I don't know what I was expecting, telling you all I did. The blame is mostly mine for this, anyway.",
      "nm33abcart04803_.mp3": "Why didn't you want to? You knew how important finding Dustil was to me! You... you've helped others, why not him? Why not me?",
      "nm33abcart04805_.mp3": "You could have. But... you're only partly to blame. I'm to blame for all the rest.",
      "nm33abcart04807_.mp3": "All the blame? No. Part of the blame, though... part of the blame is yours. The rest is mine.",
      "nm33abcart04811_.mp3": "If I was, you wouldn't have to ask. So don't worry about it.",
      "nm33abcart04814_.mp3": "All business today, eh? Are these questions really necessary?",
      "nm33abcart04815_.mp3": "I'm all ears, beautiful.",
      "nm33abcart04817_.mp3": "Which? The fact that I'm all ears or the beautiful part?",
      "nm33abcart04819_.mp3": "Not really. Just a habit. You have something you'd rather I call you by?",
      "nm33abcart04822_.mp3": "Maybe I'm just avoiding your questions. Is this really necessary?",
      "nm33abcart04824_.mp3": "Pretty snappy with the orders, are we? Okay, you got it... sir.",
      "nm33abcart04826_.mp3": "Well, that's too bad, then, because it's not going to change.",
      "nm33abcart04828_.mp3": "Heh heh. Well I might be willing to take you up on that challenge. But uh, you're just not going to let up, are you? Fine... you want to know why I don't trust anyone? Here goes.",
      "nm33abcart04829_.mp3": "Listen, sister... just because we're working together does not mean you get to badger me with constant questions!",
      "nm33abcart04831_.mp3": "Blast it if you aren't the most frustrating woman to talk to! Isn't there someone else you can harass for a little while?",
      "nm33abcart04833_.mp3": "What? Me? What did I do?",
      "nm33abcart04838_.mp3": "Oh no, I'm not falling for that one. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.",
      "nm33abcart04840_.mp3": "I... *sigh* Okay, I give up. You win.",
      "nm33abcart04844_.mp3": "Wait... *sigh* I didn't mean it that way. Don't go, damn it.",
      "nm33abcart04845_.mp3": "Look, I suppose I... could use someone to talk to. I'm just not used to it. And I don't know why you're so interested. But here goes.",
      "nm33abcart04849_.mp3": "Very cute. If you got any cuter, you'd pass for a Gamorrean's sister.",
      "nm33abcart04852_.mp3": "Look, I'm serious. No one seems to want to tell me anything, and it's starting to irritate me.",
      "nm33abcart04854_.mp3": "Well... yeah, true enough, I guess. But, damn it, I'm tired of nobody telling me anything!",
      "nm33abcart04856_.mp3": "Well, damn it, I want to know why that is! I want some questions answered!",
      "nm33abcart04859_.mp3": "Oh? I don't know if I like the sound of that...",
      "nm33abcart04861_.mp3": "I don't know. What am I going to have to do for it?",
      "nm33abcart04863_.mp3": "Oh, the usual. Well that's not so hard. Let's get to it, then, shall we?",
      "nm33abcart04866_.mp3": "I...heh, I really think that we should, ah... get going.",
      "nm33abcart04869_.mp3": "I'm sorry. I'm glad things are better between us, now. We should... we should go.",
      "nm33abcart04871_.mp3": "So... you do accept my apology. Huh. Good. Good. I'm glad.",
      "nm33abcart04872_.mp3": "You know you, uh... you aren't so bad to have around, you know that?",
      "nm33abcart04874_.mp3": "More than that. But... anyway... we should be off...",
      "nm33abcart04877_.mp3": "Right. Off we go.",
      "nm33abcart04878_.mp3": "She had courage... and she was stubborn. Heh... a little bit like you in that respect. I could never talk her out of anything once she put her mind to it.",
      "nm33abcart04880_.mp3": "I had... had nothing left after that, really. I devoted myself to the fleet. Hunting Saul was my only purpose.",
      "nm33abcart04881_.mp3": "No, no, I didn't mean it that way.",
      "nm33abcart04884_.mp3": "Err... I'm not that bad, am I?",
      "nm33abcart04887_.mp3": "Damn it, woman, if you keep hounding me I'm going to put you over my knee and teach you a lesson!",
      "nm33abcart04889_.mp3": "Oh, no, I'm not even going there, sister.",
      "nm33abcart04891_.mp3": "You just wait, you'll get yours.",
      "nm33abcart04892_.mp3": "At any rate, I wasn't ogling you. I've just been admiring you.",
      "nm33abcart04894_.mp3": "Oh, you can tell, can you?",
      "nm33abcart04898_.mp3": "Oh, yeah? Well listen, beautiful, I don't need to take this abuse. I get enough female Jedi bashing from Bastila, thank you very much.",
      "nm33abcart04900_.mp3": "Wouldn't you like to know. Just you wait, sister.",
      "nm33abcart04902_.mp3": "And just what would you do if I wasn't? No, no, wait, don't answer that. I don't want to know.",
      "nm33abcart04904_.mp3": "Uh. *That* is one bet I'm not about to take. Not a chance.",
      "nm33abcart04905_.mp3": "Anyway... as fun, uh, as this is, I do have to talk to you about something serious. Really serious. Uh, is this a good time?",
      "nm33abcart04907_.mp3": "You think so? I could probably get the same kind of attention from a blaster rifle.",
      "nm33abcart04910_.mp3": "Now *that* I'd like to see. Or would I? You've got my damn head on backwards, you know that?",
      "nm33abcart04912_.mp3": "Ha! No, wait, wait, don't go. Not just yet.",
      "nm33abcart04914_.mp3": "What?! No! I mean... no! Don't be crazy!",
      "nm33abcart04916_.mp3": "Oh no you don't! I'd have to shoot you down first, and I'm not kidding.",
      "nm33abcart04918_.mp3": "What? You must be joking. I'd be lucky not to get my eyeballs seared out of their sockets.",
      "nm33abcart04920_.mp3": "Was there ever any doubt?",
      "nm33abmeke02009_.mp3": "Well, you should know better than anyone what some people will do for power, Bastila.",
      "nm33abmeke02011_.mp3": "Well, just that the dark side is quite tempting... or so you always say. What did you think I meant?",
      "nm33abmeke02014_.mp3": "Oh, what a sweet guy. He should get the Sith congeniality medal.",
      "nm33abmekf03015_.mp3": "Somehow I think he'll get over it.",
      "nm35aacart03000_.mp3": "That datapad... take a look at it. I wonder if Dustil knows his friend was disposed of like that?",
      "nm35aacart03002_.mp3": "If not, it might convince Dustil that what we're saying about the Sith is true. It would be worth a shot.",
      "nm35aacart04000_.mp3": "What do you need?",
      "nm35aacart04002_.mp3": "Not right now. I think this datapad we found is the evidence we need. We have to bring it to Dustil right away.",
      "nm35aacart04003_.mp3": "No. What I want is to find something... anything... that will convince Dustil that we're telling the truth.",
      "nm35aacart04004_.mp3": "There must be *something* here in the academy we can bring to him, something that would show him what the Sith really are!",
      "nm35aacart04005_.mp3": "What do you need?",
      "nm35aacart04007_.mp3": "Talk about what? The only thing I want to do right now is find Dustil. If he's alive... well, there's just nothing else I want to think about.",
      "nm35aacart04008_.mp3": "I'll understand if we can't look for him right now, but if we could it would be a huge load off my mind.",
      "nm35aacart04009_.mp3": "Yes? What's on your mind?",
      "nm35aacart04015_.mp3": "Taris? The planet's all one big city... but it's golden years are long past, and things have gotten worse since the Sith occupied it.",
      "nm35aacart04016_.mp3": "From what I hear, the wealthy live on the tops of all the tall towers. And if you're poor, you live down in the shadows... and it gets worse the lower you go.",
      "nm35aacart04017_.mp3": "That's all I can think of, at any rate.",
      "nm35aacart04018_.mp3": "Dantooine's a boring place. It's all plains and herders and small settlements. Perfect for the Jedi to lose themselves in, I guess.",
      "nm35aacart04019_.mp3": "Manaan's a neutral world. They're the only source of kolto... the healing fluid... and they use that to remain free from both the Republic and the Sith.",
      "nm35aacart04020_.mp3": "Tatooine's just a desert planet. I hear the mining isn't going so well... I'd bet the colony gets abandoned before long.",
      "nm35aacart04021_.mp3": "Kashyyyk is covered by a giant forest, I hear. Trees kilometers high. The Wookiees live on the higher branches, I think.",
      "nm35aacart04022_.mp3": "Korriban's a desolate world, and a Sith planet. There's only one small colony here, I'm pretty sure.",
      "nm35aacart04023_.mp3": "I don't really know much about this place, sorry.",
      "nm35aacart04025_.mp3": "I think so. If he's anything like he used to be, Dustil hates to be tricked. There's no way he'll let the Sith trick him again.",
      "nm35aacart04026_.mp3": "As for whether or not he'll be my son again... I don't know. He's so full of anger and hate... I wasn't expecting him to be like this.",
      "nm35aacart04027_.mp3": "Maybe we can work it out. I hope so. I guess I'll have to wait and see. Thanks, by the way... for all your help.",
      "nm35aacart04029_.mp3": "There's nothing to talk about. I failed my son... just as I failed my wife. I thought that if I ever found him...",
      "nm35aacart04032_.mp3": "Me? Well, I've been a star-pilot for the Republic for years. I've seen more than my share of wars... I fought in the Mandalorian Wars before all this started.",
      "nm35aacart04033_.mp3": "But with all that, I've never experienced anything like the slaughter these Sith animals can unleash. Not even the Mandalorians were that senseless.",
      "nm35aacart04034_.mp3": "My home world was one of the first planets to fall to Malak's fleet. The Sith bombed it into submission, and there wasn't a damn thing our Republic forces could do to stop them!",
      "nm35aacart04036_.mp3": "It shouldn't be my fault. I did everything I could... I followed my orders and did my duty. That shouldn't mean I failed them! I didn't!",
      "nm35aacart04038_.mp3": "Yes. No... no, that's not what I mean. I mean... I'm sorry. I'm not making much sense, am I?",
      "nm35aacart04039_.mp3": "I'm more used to taking action... keeping my mind focused on the business at hand. So let's just do that. If you have more questions, ask them later.",
      "nm35aacart04043_.mp3": "I'm just a soldier; I go where the fleet Admirals tell me to. I follow my orders and I do my duty. It just... *sigh* doesn't seem right that doing that means I failed them! I didn't!",
      "nm35aacart04048_.mp3": "True. Bastila is as powerful as they say... she's the one who defeated Darth Revan, after all.",
      "nm35aacart04049_.mp3": "Hmm. I guess that no Jedi ability, no matter how powerful, makes up for being completely surprised and outmatched.",
      "nm35aacart04050_.mp3": "We didn't choose that battle, anyway. It got forced on us. Hell, I'm just surprised that any of us are alive to talk about it.",
      "nm35aacart04051_.mp3": "Come to think of it, it's more than a little surprising that you happen to be here, isn't it? Just what is your position with the Republic fleet, anyway?",
      "nm35aacart04053_.mp3": "Not at all. I just think it's a bit odd that someone who got added to the crew roster at the last minute just happens to be one of the survivors.",
      "nm35aacart04055_.mp3": "Don't be ridiculous. You've more than proved yourself since the crash... we wouldn't have made it this far without you. But still...",
      "nm35aacart04057_.mp3": "You were the only one. Not to mention that Bastila's party was the one who requested your transfer.",
      "nm35aacart04059_.mp3": "No. Well... maybe. Don't get me wrong, it just seems odd that someone Bastila's party specifically requested to transfer aboard happened to survive.",
      "nm35aacart04062_.mp3": "The Jedi requested numerous things when they came on board... hell, they practically took over the ship, as far as I could tell. ",
      "nm35aacart04063_.mp3": "Considering your connection to Bastila and the Jedi... whether you know it or not... your presence here seems a little convenient.",
      "nm35aacart04064_.mp3": "I'm probably wrong and this is probably nothing, I know. I learned a long time ago not to take things at face value, however. And I *hate* surprises.",
      "nm35aacart04066_.mp3": "I mean I have to expect the unexpected. Just to be safe.",
      "nm35aacart04068_.mp3": "I expect you're right. I've got no real reason to suspect you of anything. Still... it's better to be safe than sorry, right?",
      "nm35aacart04070_.mp3": "I am working with you. I'd be a fool not to. I'd also be a fool not to expect the unexpected.",
      "nm35aacart04079_.mp3": "I'm not trying to be paranoid. It's just that I learned a long time ago that something which looks like a coincidence probably isn't. Especially when the Jedi are involved.",
      "nm35aacart04081_.mp3": "A smuggler? I should have guessed. Isn't it odd, however, that a smuggler who was added to the crew at the last minute just happens to be alive?",
      "nm35aacart04083_.mp3": "Well, that makes sense. Still... it seems a bit strange that someone who was a last-minute addition to the crew roster is one of the survivors.",
      "nm35aacart04085_.mp3": "Hell no... unless you consider that you were a last-minute addition to the crew roster and you just happen to be one of the survivors.",
      "nm35aacart04087_.mp3": "I'm just trying to figure it out. I saw enough men lose their lives needlessly during the Mandalorian Wars. It's... difficult to see that happening all over again.",
      "nm35aacart04088_.mp3": "We lost the ship and a lot of good people... and for what? On the hope that Jedi powers would save us, somehow. Not that Bastila had much of an opportunity to act.",
      "nm35aacart04090_.mp3": "Neither was I, to tell the truth. I was onboard as an advisor for the most part. The battle began so fast, it's anyone's guess as to what actually happened.",
      "nm35aacart04092_.mp3": "*Sigh* I knew you wouldn't understand where I was coming from. Let me try to explain.",
      "nm35aacart04093_.mp3": "You've got the skills of an elite commando, and you've saved my butt more than once. Between that and your facility with languages, I'm lucky you're here.",
      "nm35aacart04094_.mp3": "But that doesn't mean I'm going to stop watching you or being wary. I'm just not built that way. Period.",
      "nm35aacart04096_.mp3": "Maybe so. But I've been betrayed before by people I... well, it won't happen again, that's all.",
      "nm35aacart04098_.mp3": "I don't know that you'll betray me. But there are no guarantees... not for you, not for me. You don't have to take it personally.",
      "nm35aacart04106_.mp3": "Hairless Wookiee? Alright, sister, just... just... just calm down before your head explodes.",
      "nm35aacart04112_.mp3": "Well, you can stop wondering. I'm not.",
      "nm35aacart04114_.mp3": "Me?",
      "nm35aacart04121_.mp3": "You shouldn't. If you're smart, you won't trust anyone... not me, not Bastila, and especially not yourself.",
      "nm35aacart04125_.mp3": "I don't remember ever saying anything about \"traitor\". All I mean is that if you're smart, you won't trust anyone... not me, not Bastila and especially not yourself.",
      "nm35aacart04127_.mp3": "Yeah, well, you wouldn't be the first. Look... I don't expect you to be my friend. This is just the way I am, no need to take it personally.",
      "nm35aacart04129_.mp3": "Look... I'm not trying to insult you. This is just the way I am, no need to take it personally.",
      "nm35aacart04131_.mp3": "You, uh... haven't done anything *yet*. But there's no guarantee that you won't do anything in the future. I've been betrayed before by people and I... well, it won't happen again.",
      "nm35aacart04133_.mp3": "I don't know that, yet. Like I said before, it's probably nothing. But I've been betrayed before by people and I... well, it won't happen again, that's all.",
      "nm35aacart04135_.mp3": "Oh? You want to argue some more, is that it?",
      "nm35aacart04137_.mp3": "Ha! Can't say I've met a woman quite like you before. You're really something.",
      "nm35aacart04138_.mp3": "So I've seen. If I were Malak I'd be a bit nervous to have you on my tail.",
      "nm35aacart04140_.mp3": "What does it matter that much? Why can't you just leave it be?",
      "nm35aacart04142_.mp3": "And I don't really want to argue with you, either. You seem... sincere enough, I guess.",
      "nm35aacart04143_.mp3": "I just don't trust easily, and for good reasons... which are my own.",
      "nm35aacart04147_.mp3": "Ahhh, damn it. I suppose I won't get any rest until I talk, will I? You want to know why I don't trust anyone? Fine, here goes.",
      "nm35aacart04148_.mp3": "Five years ago the Jedi had just finished the war with the Mandalorians. Revan and Malak were heroes. I was damn proud to have served in their fleet.",
      "nm35aacart04149_.mp3": "It was completely unexpected when they turned on us, invading the Republic while we were still weak. Nobody knew what to think, least of all me.",
      "nm35aacart04150_.mp3": "Our heroes had become brutal, conquering Sith... and we were all but helpless before them. Think about it... if you can't even trust the best of the Jedi, who can you trust?",
      "nm35aacart04152_.mp3": "It... it's not that. It's... That's not what I mean. There were... there were others. Good, solid, trusted men who joined them.",
      "nm35aacart04154_.mp3": "I... of course the Jedi turned to the dark side. There were others, however, who weren't Jedi. Good men... trusted men who joined them.",
      "nm35aacart04156_.mp3": "I... it wasn't even that. There were others: good, solid men. Trusted men who turned on us, as well, and joined their cause.",
      "nm35aacart04157_.mp3": "Malak and Revan and the Sith deserve to die for what they've done... but the ones who fled the Republic and joined them are even worse.",
      "nm35aacart04158_.mp3": "The dark side has nothing to do with why they joined with the Sith. They deserve no mercy!",
      "nm35aacart04161_.mp3": "I know. I... should apologize to you. I've become so accustomed to expecting the worst in others, and you've done nothing to deserve that.",
      "nm35aacart04162_.mp3": "It's just... never mind. Let's just continue with what we were doing. I'd rather not talk about it.",
      "nm35aacart04164_.mp3": "I thought I said I didn't want to talk about it anymore.",
      "nm35aacart04166_.mp3": "Not particularly. I... guess it wouldn't hurt, exactly, either, though I don't know why you're so interested.",
      "nm35aacart04168_.mp3": "Cute. Nice to know that you're so full of concern. *Sigh* Well, I guess it wouldn't hurt, though I don't know why you're so interested.",
      "nm35aacart04170_.mp3": "I... suppose you're right. Fine, then. But I don't know why you're so interested, but here it goes.",
      "nm35aacart04171_.mp3": "When I think of all the men who have betrayed us, the one that stands out above them all is the one I respected the most. Saul.",
      "nm35aacart04173_.mp3": "You don't? I thought everyone did. Admiral Saul Karath is the commander of the entire Sith fleet. He's half the reason Malak has done so well in the war.",
      "nm35aacart04174_.mp3": "Saul was my commanding officer back when the Mandalorian Wars first began. He taught me everything about being a soldier... and I looked up to him.",
      "nm35aacart04175_.mp3": "Saul approached me before he left. He talked to me about how the Republic was on the losing side... and about how I should start thinking of my survival.",
      "nm35aacart04176_.mp3": "I know now that he was trying to recruit me into the Sith, but I couldn't have conceived of it back then. I argued with him and he got angry and he left. I never saw him again.",
      "nm35aacart04178_.mp3": "Saul was my mentor... he led us to so many victories against the Mandalorians, even when things looked to be at their worst.",
      "nm35aacart04179_.mp3": "I just... I couldn't conceive of it. He... he couldn't be serious. I was wrong, of course... he not only left us for the Sith, he... he gave them the codes to bypass our scanners.",
      "nm35aacart04180_.mp3": "I remember waking up as the first of the Sith bombers snuck past our defenses and began destroying half of our docked ships. I knew right away what had happened.",
      "nm35aacart04181_.mp3": "I... could have stopped him. I could have stopped it all.",
      "nm35aacart04183_.mp3": "I blame Saul, not myself. I was... I was stupid and I ignored the danger. He nearly destroyed us all.",
      "nm35aacart04185_.mp3": "I don't know. Maybe. He might have killed me if I'd tried, or I might have killed him. I was stupid, however, and I let him go.",
      "nm35aacart04187_.mp3": "Don't even start with that! I don't feel sorry for myself. I feel angry... at Saul and all those others. It's all I can think about sometimes!",
      "nm35aacart04188_.mp3": "I've fought Saul for years, now, and if I ever catch up to him... he will regret what he's done. He will regret it.",
      "nm35aacart04190_.mp3": "No. No, it's not.",
      "nm35aacart04191_.mp3": "But I don't want to talk about it right now. Let's go.",
      "nm35aacart04193_.mp3": "Have I been quiet? I suppose I have. I guess I just don't like being left out of the loop.",
      "nm35aacart04195_.mp3": "Left out of the loop. You know. Not being told anything... strung along. It's really starting to irritate me.",
      "nm35aacart04196_.mp3": "For one thing, I want to know what the Jedi Council said to you. They pulled you in there and refused to tell me a thing about it.",
      "nm35aacart04197_.mp3": "*That* is none of your concern, Carth, and you would do well to leave the matter be.",
      "nm35aacart04198_.mp3": "I respect you, Bastila, but you've been as close-mouthed as the rest of the Council. If you won't talk to me, then maybe somebody else will.",
      "nm35aacart04199_.mp3": "I'm rather curious to know what went on... and why they didn't keep you on Dantooine for training. Isn't that strange?",
      "nm35aacart04201_.mp3": "I may not know much about the Jedi, but I do know they aren't famous for taking on old Padawans and sending them on dangerous assignments.",
      "nm35aacart04203_.mp3": "A bond? What kind of bond? You mean to say that they told you you were \"tied\" to Bastila in some way? Heh. I have trouble believing that.",
      "nm35aacart04204_.mp3": "You're a neophyte Padawan who's been saddled with the responsibility of tracking down these Star Maps. Why? That's not normal!",
      "nm35aacart04206_.mp3": "I'll tell you this much... I am *not* going to wait around until I'm betrayed again!",
      "nm35aacart04208_.mp3": "Well, we'll just see about that, won't we?",
      "nm35aacart04210_.mp3": "Nothing. Not yet. You just better hope I don't get a reason to.",
      "nm35aacart04212_.mp3": "Fine. You got it. Conversation over.",
      "nm35aacart04217_.mp3": "And what does that mean? Is this more of that destiny garbage that the Jedi keep talking about? Well, that can't be it!",
      "nm35aacart04218_.mp3": "I've been watching you... you can be cruel and impulsive. A Jedi without self-control or training, and yet the Council sends you on your way? Why?",
      "nm35aacart04220_.mp3": "That's completely beside the point. The Jedi encouraged you to stay with us, and I don't believe the reasons they gave.",
      "nm35aacart04222_.mp3": "None of my business? Uh, I'm sorry... aren't I a part of this mission? The Jedi may be in charge, but I'm risking all the same things you are!",
      "nm35aacart04224_.mp3": "Are we? Why, then, does it seem like the Jedi know everything and leave the rest of us out in the cold?",
      "nm35aacart04226_.mp3": "You can be sick of whatever you like. What I'm sick of is being kept in the dark!",
      "nm35aacart04228_.mp3": "And why is that? You were a great help on Taris, but why would they keep you with us? Don't they... don't they have to train you?",
      "nm35aacart04230_.mp3": "No? Well, you certainly aren't helping matters any, either, and it's really starting to irritate me.",
      "nm35aacart04232_.mp3": "Listen, sister, I don't remember reading anywhere that it's a requirement that you remain with us after we left Taris, yet here you are.",
      "nm35aacart04233_.mp3": "You want to be smart, do you? Fine. So long as I get some questions answered.",
      "nm35aacart04235_.mp3": "I, ahhh... I'm not very good at this. I... I know I owe you an apology. Uh, more than one, probably.",
      "nm35aacart04236_.mp3": "I was just so desperate to finally face Saul directly in the battle over Taris, and now the Jedi have us looking for these... these Star Maps.",
      "nm35aacart04237_.mp3": "I know this mission is important, it's just... I feel a bit useless. I can fight, sure, but I'm no Jedi... all this feels completely out of my league.",
      "nm35aacart04239_.mp3": "It doesn't, I know. It's... been a while since I even had to think about that sort of thing.",
      "nm35aacart04240_.mp3": "I just hate not knowing what's going on and feeling this... helpless. But I shouldn't have taken that out on you. I've been a royal pain in the backside, haven't I?",
      "nm35aacart04242_.mp3": "I guess there's no harm done then. Still I, uh... I should know better by now.",
      "nm35aacart04243_.mp3": "So... I'm sorry. Will you accept my apology?",
      "nm35aacart04245_.mp3": "Done! Let's get underway, then, shall we... partner?",
      "nm35aacart04247_.mp3": "Don't drown me in sentiment, already. *Sigh* Fair enough, let's move on.",
      "nm35aacart04249_.mp3": "Ha! Well... I guess I should be at least a little pleased that I haven't lost my touch.",
      "nm35aacart04251_.mp3": "No, I do worry about it. I've traveled the lanes more than once, I should know better than this.",
      "nm35aacart04253_.mp3": "Because this is more important. This may really, finally, make a difference... I suppose even if I can't figure out everything that's going on, I still want to help if I can.",
      "nm35aacart04255_.mp3": "You don't exactly pull any punches, do you? Not that I don't deserve it, I suppose.",
      "nm35aacart04258_.mp3": "I already told you. He betrayed us all.",
      "nm35aacart04260_.mp3": "Well, There... there is more to it. I'm... I'm sure you don't want to hear about it.",
      "nm35aacart04262_.mp3": "It's just that I... don't talk about it very much. Ok?",
      "nm35aacart04263_.mp3": "I told you about my homeworld. Telos. Four years ago, Saul led the Sith fleet there and demanded its surrender. The planet refused and Saul proceeded to devastate its entire surface. Millions died.",
      "nm35aacart04264_.mp3": "I had... a wife and son on Telos. I thought they would be safe there. But my task force arrived too late to be of much help.",
      "nm35aacart04265_.mp3": "We didn't have enough medical supplies. The colony was burning and the dying were everywhere. I remember holding my wife and screaming for the medics. They... didn't come in time.",
      "nm35aacart04267_.mp3": "Of course not. How could you? I... had nothing left after that, really. I devoted myself to the fleet. Hunting Saul was my only purpose.",
      "nm35aacart04268_.mp3": "I... miss them. I know killing Saul won't bring them back, and it won't make me happy again... but I have to do it.",
      "nm35aacart04269_.mp3": "I don't expect you to understand. I have to pay him back for what he's done... I have to. It's all I have left.",
      "nm35aacart04271_.mp3": "No, it's alright, I don't mind. You deserved some kind of... explanation.",
      "nm35aacart04273_.mp3": "I've... never talked about it before. To anyone. I suppose it's time I finally did.",
      "nm35aacart04275_.mp3": "His name was Dustil and I don't know what happened to him. The colony was a complete ruin, and we never found any trace of him.",
      "nm35aacart04276_.mp3": "I made inquiries and followed the reports from Telos for years, but... I stopped.",
      "nm35aacart04277_.mp3": "Anyway... I hope that answers your questions. Let's, uh... let's continue with what we were doing.",
      "nm35aacart04278_.mp3": "Anyway... that's the story. For what it's worth.",
      "nm35aacart04281_.mp3": "She had courage and ... and she was stubborn. I could never talk her out of anything once she put her mind to it.",
      "nm35aacart04282_.mp3": "And she hated it when I signed back onto the fleet at the start of the war. I had planned on... on leaving soon, to join her...",
      "nm35aacart04284_.mp3": "Yes. I can't forgive Saul for this. He took everything from me, even... even my trust. I hope you can understand that.",
      "nm35aacart04286_.mp3": "Gotten over it? Look - my family was everything to me. Once they were gone... I had nothing. Hunting Saul became my only purpose.",
      "nm35aacart04289_.mp3": "To think that I once looked up to those two as the best that humanity had to offer. Now I'd like nothing more than to put a blaster to both their heads.",
      "nm35aacart04290_.mp3": "Although I suppose only Malak is left, isn't he? Turned on his own master, not that Revan didn't have it coming. Heh. Typical for their kind, I guess.",
      "nm35aacart04292_.mp3": "No, not personally. They aided the Republic during the Mandalorian wars. They were heroes. Without them the Mandaloreans would have finished us for certain.",
      "nm35aacart04293_.mp3": "In the fleet, we didn't see much of the Jedi. I only met Malak once, but I was impressed by him. I guess that just shows how much the dark side can change someone.",
      "nm35aacart04295_.mp3": "I, uh... used to think that it was a fancy name for something that I see every day. Corruption is everywhere. People are greedy and stupid and do horrible things.",
      "nm35aacart04296_.mp3": "I'm starting to think it's different for the Jedi, however. That there's this evil watching them, waiting for its chance.",
      "nm35aacart04297_.mp3": "I've been watching you. You have this, uh... incredible darkness inside you. Some of the things you do disturb me.",
      "nm35aacart04298_.mp3": "It's not just you. It's Bastila, as well. She's so... intense. I don't pretend to know much about the Force... but I know evil.",
      "nm35aacart04300_.mp3": "No, of course not. All I'm saying is that when you have so much power, the stakes are higher. I can only imagine the kind of conflict that goes on inside you.",
      "nm35aacart04301_.mp3": "Neither you nor Bastila are fully trained on how to handle your power. I'm just concerned at what might come.",
      "nm35aacart04303_.mp3": "Well, that's not what I... I mean... I wouldn't want to see you hurt. Either of you.",
      "nm35aacart04304_.mp3": "I suppose finding the Star Maps is more important than your training... and your safety. I just hope there isn't a price for you to pay.",
      "nm35aacart04306_.mp3": "I know that, and Bastila says the same thing. You're both incredible women. I'm just... I'm just not sure this is the kind of thing you can defeat.",
      "nm35aacart04308_.mp3": "I didn't mean to... <Sigh> Fine, fine. I suppose I shouldn't stick my nose where it doesn't belong. I'll leave you be.",
      "nm35aacart04310_.mp3": "No? I know how people change. I remember how Malak looked and acted before his return... I bet the old Malak discounted the possibility that he would ever fall, as well.",
      "nm35aacart04313_.mp3": "That's a frightening thought. I hope you're right.",
      "nm35aacart04314_.mp3": "You have so much courage and strength in you... yet, somehow, I have no trouble imagining it differently. Like the flip side of a coin.",
      "nm35aacart04316_.mp3": "Nobody does. When they left after the Mandalorian wars ended, they were Jedi. When they returned... they were something else.",
      "nm35aacart04318_.mp3": "Well... when they returned from wherever they went, they had an entire fleet with them. Nobody knows where they got the ships.",
      "nm35aacart04319_.mp3": "They had a lot of them and as the years have passed there always seems to be more and more... while our forces dwindle.",
      "nm35aacart04320_.mp3": "Did they really get away with it, though? Revan was betrayed by Malak... and Malak hasn't won. In the end, the dark side won't help him.",
      "nm35aacart04322_.mp3": "Oh... it's nothing. Sorry.",
      "nm35aacart04324_.mp3": "I told you my wife died four years ago. I... I've just been trying to remember what she looked like.",
      "nm35aacart04325_.mp3": "It shouldn't be so difficult. I can remember things about her... things she did. The way she smiled, what her hair smelled like, our last fight... just not her face.",
      "nm35aacart04326_.mp3": "I try to hold it in my head but it's gone. Is... that strange? Maybe I shouldn't be talking to you about this.",
      "nm35aacart04328_.mp3": "Ahhh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have mentioned it, even if you asked. I just find you, I don't know... easy to talk to.",
      "nm35aacart04330_.mp3": "But I *should* be able to remember her face. It's frustrating! I... feel like I'm losing her.",
      "nm35aacart04331_.mp3": "I, uh... it must look really strange for me to be obsessing like this, still. You must think I'm incredibly stupid.",
      "nm35aacart04333_.mp3": "I... suppose you're probably right. But I have to do it, anyway.",
      "nm35aacart04334_.mp3": "The only thing that's kept me going since she died has been the need to find Saul and kill him. It's better to think about that than... anything else.",
      "nm35aacart04335_.mp3": "If I can do that, then maybe I can let her go. Let it all go.",
      "nm35aacart04336_.mp3": "If we encounter Saul... if we ever have the chance, promise me that I will be the one to kill him. I have to settle this... I need to.",
      "nm35aacart04339_.mp3": "Thank you. I... guess there's really nothing else to say.",
      "nm35aacart04341_.mp3": "Whether it does or not, that's the way it has to be. I... guess there's no need to discuss it until then.",
      "nm35aacart04343_.mp3": "Maybe. It can't be worse than what I tell myself, sometimes.",
      "nm35aacart04345_.mp3": "She isn't a ghost to me. I still remember holding her as she died... and I doubt I'll forget until I've paid Saul back in kind.",
      "nm35aacart04346_.mp3": "That's all I have left: finding Saul and killing the scum. Don't worry... I won't waste any more time until then.",
      "nm35aacart04348_.mp3": "That's a damned mean thing to say. I wasn't ready for her to go, I can't accept it. Alright?",
      "nm35aacart04350_.mp3": "Moping? I'm not moping! I... okay, fine, maybe I'm moping a little, but you're very pushy, you know that?",
      "nm35aacart04352_.mp3": "You mean if I kill him?",
      "nm35aacart04354_.mp3": "I... never thought about it. I suppose I always assumed that I would be dead once Saul was.",
      "nm35aacart04356_.mp3": "Understand that whenever I envisioned taking on Saul in the past, it was always as the captain of my own ship... or alone. In those cases I would risk everything.",
      "nm35aacart04357_.mp3": "I'm not in the same situation, now. I wouldn't risk hurting you... or the others.",
      "nm35aacart04359_.mp3": "You don't think I would throw away everything we're doing here, do you?",
      "nm35aacart04361_.mp3": "I would like to think that I wouldn't put you in danger. That I wouldn't forget that there's more behind Saul that needs to be stopped.",
      "nm35aacart04362_.mp3": "If I saw Saul, however... if I had the chance... I don't know what I would do. I really don't. I mean his death has been my entire focus for so long.",
      "nm35aacart04364_.mp3": "Well, that's easier said than done, but I know you mean well. I promise you I'll see this through. No matter what.",
      "nm35aacart04365_.mp3": "As for what comes afterward... well, let's wait until I know that I'm around to see it.",
      "nm35aacart04367_.mp3": "I know. I'll... see this through. I promise you that. No matter what.",
      "nm35aacart04369_.mp3": "But, uh... maybe it's best I did. I have to see this through... and I will, to the end. I promise you that. No matter what.",
      "nm35aacart04371_.mp3": "Of course it means something to me! The Sith have to be stopped! You think it doesn't matter to me that everyone on Taris is dead? That the Republic is in danger?",
      "nm35aacart04374_.mp3": "That's never occurred to me. I've always been the captain of my own ship, after all... or thought about going after Saul on my own.",
      "nm35aacart04376_.mp3": "Oh. I hadn't thought you'd noticed...",
      "nm35aacart04378_.mp3": "Well, I ah... I've just been admiring you. Not, uhh, not anything like that, though...",
      "nm35aacart04382_.mp3": "I've been watching you in action. Your, your skills... you have a natural talent that is incredible.",
      "nm35aacart04383_.mp3": "Not that, ah, all I do is watch you or anything. I don't mean anything by it.",
      "nm35aacart04385_.mp3": "Ha! Why didn't you tell me that sooner? You would have saved me a lot of trouble.",
      "nm35aacart04386_.mp3": "I will say one thing, however. We've come a long way with your help. Whether it's the Force or fate or just dumb luck... I'm glad you're here.",
      "nm35aacart04387_.mp3": "We probably would have never made it this far without you. I... should have said this long before, instead of doubting you. I, ah, hope you can forgive me.",
      "nm35aacart04389_.mp3": "I guess I'm a proud man. I... don't admit things like this easily.",
      "nm35aacart04391_.mp3": "Because you're an impressive and beautiful woman. In some ways... good ways... you remind me of my wife and I'd like to make things right between us.",
      "nm35aacart04393_.mp3": "Thank you. Let's, ah... let's get back to what we were doing.",
      "nm35aacart04396_.mp3": "And you accepted it... but that doesn't mean I'm forgiven. I'd like to be.",
      "nm35aacart04398_.mp3": "Err... what do you mean?",
      "nm35aacart04400_.mp3": "What am I supposed to say? I was wrong. I was a stubborn fool. I... Look, I have trouble admitting it when a beautiful woman has my number...ok?",
      "nm35aacart04402_.mp3": "I'll, ah, take that as a yes. I'm glad that's settled. Shall we... shall we get back to what we were doing?",
      "nm35aacart04405_.mp3": "Sorry. Didn't mean to... embarass you. I'll stop.",
      "nm35aacart04407_.mp3": "Well... maybe a few. I hope you won't mind if I keep those to myself.",
      "nm35aacart04409_.mp3": "Oh. Right. I'll, ah, I'll just pay attention to what I'm doing...",
      "nm35aacart04411_.mp3": "I do. It's serious, though... I need your attention. Is this a good time?",
      "nm35aacart04413_.mp3": "Alright. I'm, uh... I'm concerned about you. I've been keeping these thoughts to myself, mostly, but I think it's time I say something.",
      "nm35aacart04415_.mp3": "It's about you. I'm worried about what you're doing to yourself... how much you've succumbed to violence and anger.",
      "nm35aacart04416_.mp3": "I knew it was possible for this to happen to you... and it just pains me to see it. I've been down this path. And I don't recommend it.",
      "nm35aacart04417_.mp3": "It's about you. I'm worried about what might happen to you. You have a lot of courage, and the fact you've remained strong is amazing, but there is even greater danger ahead.",
      "nm35aacart04418_.mp3": "I think you might be setting yourself up for a fall. Maybe at the urging of the Jedi, I don't know... but you're definitely going to become a target.",
      "nm35aacart04419_.mp3": "If, uh... if I'm going to find some purpose beyond taking revenge on Saul, then it's going to have to be in protecting you.",
      "nm35aacart04420_.mp3": "I don't know why, but I think some terrible fate is waiting for you. I think the Jedi Council knows it, too. And I don't want that to come to pass.",
      "nm35aacart04422_.mp3": "That's where I think you're wrong. You can't do this on your own. Nobody could.",
      "nm35aacart04424_.mp3": "I *sigh* I... don't know. I'm not the best of men, and I'm not the strongest fighter there is... but I'll find a way.",
      "nm35aacart04426_.mp3": "I know that there's going to come a day when you'll look in the mirror and wonder how you ever got to become what you are... and by then it will be too late.",
      "nm35aacart04428_.mp3": "Don't chalk it up to my paranoia just yet. Something isn't right. I blamed it on you, before, but I... I think the Jedi didn't tell us everything.",
      "nm35aacart04429_.mp3": "If I'm going to live past Saul, I need you to, as well. Let me protect you... from yourself, from the Sith... you have to let me try.",
      "nm35aacart04431_.mp3": "Because... because I never got the chance to save my wife and son. Because I didn't stop Saul when I had the chance.",
      "nm35aacart04432_.mp3": "Because I finally have the chance to do it right. You are an extraordinary woman... you make me think that maybe I might have some purpose beyond revenge.",
      "nm35aacart04433_.mp3": "I don't know whether it means anything to you... but it does to me.",
      "nm35aacart04437_.mp3": "I'm glad to hear that. I'll do my best.",
      "nm35aacart04439_.mp3": "I, uh... I guess I have no other choice. I will still help you, if I can... but I guess you're on your own.",
      "nm35aacart04440_.mp3": "If that's the way you want it, I hope things go well. Let's, uh... let's get back to what we were doing.",
      "nm35aacart04442_.mp3": "Alright. We'll talk later, then.",
      "nm35aacart04444_.mp3": "If you're ready to talk, then yes... so am I.",
      "nm35aacart04446_.mp3": "I can't hate you. I tried... I wanted to hold you responsible for all the things you've done. For my... for my wife, for Telos... for Dustil. But I can't.",
      "nm35aacart04448_.mp3": "I got the revenge I always wanted when Saul died, but it hasn't brought me the peace that I thought it would.",
      "nm35aacart04449_.mp3": "All I can think of now is the promise I made to protect you from what's going to come. It's given me a reason to look past simple revenge.",
      "nm35aacart04450_.mp3": "You have a darkness inside you that must be Revan. But there's more to you, as well. I see it, I know it's there.",
      "nm35aacart04451_.mp3": "Despite whatever part of Revan is inside you, the... the darkness that must surely be there, it isn't who you are.",
      "nm35aacart04452_.mp3": "That's why I can't hate you, why I don't want any more revenge. You don't have to be Revan, you can be so much more. Whatever the Jedi did to you, they gave you that chance.",
      "nm35aacart04453_.mp3": "You have this huge destiny waiting for you, and I just fear that if you're alone it could swallow you whole. I mean, is there room in there for me? Will you let me help you?",
      "nm35aacart04455_.mp3": "Whatever's happened up until this point, there's going to come a time very soon where you're going to have to make a choice. And there won't be any turning back.",
      "nm35aacart04456_.mp3": "I want you to make the right choice. I want to give you a reason to.",
      "nm35aacart04458_.mp3": "Well then I hope I can save you. From yourself.",
      "nm35aacart04460_.mp3": "You gave me a future. I want to give you a future, too... with me. I think I could love you, if you give me the chance.",
      "nm35aacart04462_.mp3": "Well then I'm... I'm glad. Let's... let's face the future together, then... there's still a lot to do.",
      "nm35aacart04464_.mp3": "Neither do I. But does that really matter if we love each other?",
      "nm35aacart04470_.mp3": "I think I would be hurt worse if I didn't try.",
      "nm35aacart04473_.mp3": "Oh. I had... hoped that there might be. I don't blame you. Uh. You're not the same woman I met on Taris anymore, are you?",
      "nm35aacart04474_.mp3": "Well, thank you for your honesty. I still intend to see this through to the end, whatever happens. Malak needs to be stopped.",
      "nm35aacart04475_.mp3": "And uh, you... you'll make the decision you have to. And we'll have to deal with that day when it comes.",
      "nm35aacart04478_.mp3": "Maybe you shouldn't. I would hope that my standing by you would mean something to you, but maybe it doesn't. Maybe it just can't.",
      "nm35aacart04480_.mp3": "You got it.",
      "nm35aacart04481_.mp3": "I'm not really sure. You can figure it out on your own, can't you?",
      "nm35aacart04482_.mp3": "Sorry. I can't be of much help with that.",
      "nm35aacart04729_.mp3": "All I've been trying to say is that this isn't personal. If you were smart, you wouldn't trust anyone, either... not me, not Bastila and especially not yourself.",
      "nm35aacart04731_.mp3": "Wouldn't think of it. Feel better now?",
      "nm35aacart04734_.mp3": "Well... there's more to the story, I guess.",
      "nm35aacart04737_.mp3": "I didn't want to, maybe. Are you so sure you would have?",
      "nm35aacart04739_.mp3": "With good reason. Admiral Saul Karath is the commander of the entire Sith fleet. He's half the reason Malak has done so well in the war.",
      "nm35aacart04747_.mp3": "Is there something else you'd prefer I called you?",
      "nm35aacart04749_.mp3": "Heh heh. A little bit touchy, are we? Is there something else you'd prefer I called you?",
      "nm35aacart04751_.mp3": "Don't get yourself in a twist over it, gorgeous. I didn't mean anything by it.",
      "nm35aacart04753_.mp3": "Oh, for crying out -- fine. If it'll make you feel better, you call me something. Go ahead, come on, I can take it.",
      "nm35aacart04755_.mp3": "What? Are you afraid you'll hurt my feelings? Come on, spit it out. You can do it.",
      "nm35aacart04757_.mp3": "Is that it? You can do better than that!",
      "nm35aacart04759_.mp3": "Ouch. Heh heh heh. That *is* better. Well, I bet \"beautiful\" doesn't sound so bad in comparison now, does it?",
      "nm35aacart04761_.mp3": "Stubborn as ever. Okay, you got me. I bet you have your heart set on those questions. Are they really necessary?",
      "nm35aacart04763_.mp3": "Guilty as charged. I'll bet you still have those questions in mind, though. Are they really necessary?",
      "nm35aacart04770_.mp3": "I might consider it. What are you going to call me, in exchange?",
      "nm35aacart04772_.mp3": "I like the first part of that. I'm a bit more partial to \"the most handsome pilot in the galaxy\". What do you think?",
      "nm35aacart04774_.mp3": "Well, then, I guess \"gorgeous\" will have to do until then, won't it?",
      "nm35aacart04775_.mp3": "Kidding aside, I bet you're not about to give up on those questions of yours. Are they really necessary?",
      "nm35aacart04778_.mp3": "You do? Fair enough. What do you want to discuss?",
      "nm35aacarth2002_.mp3": "I'm sorry, Dustil. I did all I could, and I... failed you.",
      "nm35aadust01006_.mp3": "I have a datapad I want you to look at. You knew someone named Selene?",
      "nm35aadust01010_.mp3": "Look at it. It belongs to Master Uthar, doesn't it?",
      "nm35aadust01014_.mp3": "Killed her because she was hindering your progress. Superiority at any cost, Dustil. There's your evil. Or can you live with that?",
      "nm35aadust01018_.mp3": "Well, there's the son I remember. Now will you leave here?",
      "nm35aadust01024_.mp3": "I... don't suppose there's any way I could talk you out of that, is there? I mean, you're not going to do anything half way. Sounds familiar.",
      "nm35aadust01028_.mp3": "I'd like that.",
      "nm35aadust01030_.mp3": "I don't have anything. Yet. But I haven't given up on you, Dustil.",
      "nm35aadust01034_.mp3": "Please... don't say that...",
      "nm35aadust01062_.mp3": "Dustil? Is that you?",
      "nm35aadust01066_.mp3": "Dustil... what? What are you talking about? I... I thought you were dead!",
      "nm35aadust01072_.mp3": "No, I didn't abandon you! The task force just arrived too late. Telos was in ruins, and your mother... I held her while...",
      "nm35aadust01074_.mp3": "But I looked for you. I swear I looked everywhere --",
      "nm35aadust01078_.mp3": "I didn't have a choice! I was needed...",
      "nm35aadust01084_.mp3": "The Sith? You can't mean that! No, the Sith killed your mother! The Sith destroyed Telos!",
      "nm35aadust01088_.mp3": "No, you've been brainwashed. The son I knew would never --",
      "nm35aadust01092_.mp3": "I don't know what's been done to you, but you're coming with me out of here. Now.",
      "nm35aadust01098_.mp3": "You can't mean that! The Sith are... they're evil. They're the dark side. They... they took me away from you and your mother. They're... they're what took you from me!",
      "nm35aadust01102_.mp3": "The Sith war to conquer, to rule the helpless. I went to war for *you*, Dustil. For your freedom, your future!",
      "nm35aadust01106_.mp3": "If I failed you, son, then it's... it's *my* failure. Please don't add to it by becoming part of something evil.",
      "nm35aadust01119_.mp3": "I... got it, Dustil. I'll be back. I swear it.",
      "nm35aadust01122_.mp3": "I... wish I could help you, son. I truly do.",
      "nm35aadust01126_.mp3": "You're going to have to fight your own battles, Dustil. I've...I've fought all I can for you.",
      "nm35aadust01130_.mp3": "Shut up! Stay out of this!",
      "nm35aadust01138_.mp3": "No! I won't accept that! I won't give up on him!!",
      "nm35aadust01142_.mp3": "Stop it, Dustil! Stop it! I won't let you go on like this! What have they done to you?!",
      "nm35aadust01146_.mp3": "No... no, that's not true! I was there when you were younger, but I had to leave to fight! I fought for *you*, for your freedom!",
      "nm35aadust01150_.mp3": "No, Dustil, don't! I don't --",
      "nm35aadust01163_.mp3": "I'm proud of you, Dustil. You aren't hanging onto a lie after you see it for what it is. Not everyone could do that.",
      "nm35aadust01165_.mp3": "Goodbye, son. Good luck.",
      "nm35aajord10003_.mp3": "I was. I crashed.",
      "nm35aajord10012_.mp3": "So, what are you doing here, Jordo? The last time I saw you was on, um... well, Telos, actually.",
      "nm35aajord10015_.mp3": "My... boy? You mean... Dustil?",
      "nm35aajord10018_.mp3": "No! Jordo, Dustil has been missing since the attack on Telos! Are you... are you absolutely certain it was him?!",
      "nm35aajord10020_.mp3": "What do you mean he's joined the Sith?",
      "nm35aajord10022_.mp3": "No... no, I... I didn't. Well, thanks for telling me, Jordo.",
      "nm35aajord10024_.mp3": "Dustil... Dustil is alive! We have to go to the Korriban academy and find him!",
      "nm35aajord10026_.mp3": "You think I don't know that? I just... if there's a chance we can try to find him... I don't want to wait to track him down, if possible.",
      "nm35aajord10028_.mp3": "Thank you. I... I just have to see him. I have to know what happened to him.",
      "nm35aajord10030_.mp3": "I don't know. I don't know why Dustil would be with the Sith... but I... I have to find out. There's simply no choice.",
      "nm35aajord10031_.mp3": "All this time I've thought he was... he must be a man by now...",
      "nm35aalash07035_.mp3": "Quiet, already!",
      "nm35aalash07037_.mp3": "Keep it up and I'll gag you. Are you forgetting where we are? Now be quiet.",
      "nm35aautha22069_.mp3": "So it's a popularity contest, basically? Wonderful.",
      "nm35aautha22088_.mp3": "I'd love to know what's going on in that tricky mind of yours.",
      "nm35aautha22159_.mp3": "We should have kept that. It could have made a --",
      "nm35aayuth24015_.mp3": "Darth Malak went there? Very interesting... isn't it, master?",
      "nm37aafree04106_.mp3": "I suppose that's the nature of the dark side. Power, but no longevity. Eventually it just consumes itself.",
      "nm37aashaa05004_.mp3": "You wouldn't have considered, oh, I don't know... getting it yourself?",
      "nm38aaassa01109_.mp3": "I knew there would be a catch. There's always a catch.",
      "nm38abmeke03041_.mp3": "I don't suppose the fact that he's weak as a newborn kith pup has anything to do with his decision?",
      "nm39aastar99004_.mp3": "Why am I not surprised to find one of the Star Maps in a place like this?",
      "nm39aastar99005_.mp3": "I guess we can get out of here now. I won't be missing this place, that's for sure.",
      "nm40aabast01001_.mp3": "They tortured all of us, though you got the worst of it by far. Saul wanted them to make us suffer. He's become some sort of sadistic monster.",
      "nm40aabast01010_.mp3": "None of this will matter if we don't get out of this prison before Saul gets back!",
      "nm40aabast01012_.mp3": "Saul mentioned that Lord Malak was on his way. I think the Admiral left to prepare for his arrival... and to report the results of our interrogation.",
      "nm40aabast01020_.mp3": "Stop it, both of you! Bastila, you... you can't honestly say how you would have reacted in that situation - nobody can! Besides, Saul already had all the information. I could tell. ",
      "nm40aabast01022_.mp3": "Don't be so hard on yourself. I've known the Admiral a long time. I could see that he already knew the answers to the questions he was asking.",
      "nm40aabast01026_.mp3": "I've known Admiral Karath a long time and I think you're right.",
      "nm40aabast01027_.mp3": "The interrogation was a sham. Saul was toying with us. He didn't care what we told him. I think it was just an excuse to torture us before Malak arrived.",
      "nm40aabast01029_.mp3": "Well, then we better hope Mission busts us out of here before he arrives.",
      "nm40aabast01030_.mp3": "Well, then we better hope T3-M4 busts us out of here before he arrives.",
      "nm40aabast01031_.mp3": "Well, then we better hope Jolee busts us out of here before he arrives.",
      "nm40aabast01032_.mp3": "Well, then we better hope Canderous busts us out of here before he arrives.",
      "nm40aabast01033_.mp3": "Well, then we better hope Juhani busts us out of here before he arrives.",
      "nm40aabast01034_.mp3": "Well, then we better hope HK-47 busts us out of here before he arrives.",
      "nm40aabast01037_.mp3": "Forget about it, Bastila. It doesn't matter anyway. I've known the Admiral a long time. I could see that he already knew the answers to the questions he was asking.",
      "nm40aabast01047_.mp3": "I, uh... I have to confess something. There was a... there was a moment - just a moment - when part of me was hoping that you would tell him what he wanted to know. Just to make the horrible pain stop.",
      "nm40aabast01049_.mp3": "No, I know you wouldn't ever do anything to intentionally cause me pain. But you had no other choice. You couldn't betray our cause.",
      "nm40aabast01050_.mp3": "I... I don't honestly know if I could have been as strong in your position. To watch you suffer like that I... I might have cracked.",
      "nm40aabast01052_.mp3": "You... you wanted me to suffer? You enjoyed my torment? I... I don't know what to say. I thought there was a... a bond between us.",
      "nm40aabast01053_.mp3": "Maybe you're not the woman I thought you were.",
      "nm40aabast01060_.mp3": "Good job, Mission! I knew you wouldn't let us down. When we get out of this I'm going to see you get a medal from the Republic for everything you've done!",
      "nm40aabast01061_.mp3": "If I remember the layout of this ship our equipment should be in a storage chamber just through the north doors. After we grab our stuff we need to get to the main bridge controls.",
      "nm40aabast01062_.mp3": "The bridge is the only place we can open the docking gates of the hangar where they've got the Ebon Hawk. We have to open those gates before we can fly out of here! ",
      "nm40aabast01068_.mp3": "Count me in, then. I've got a score to settle with the Admiral before we get off this ship, and I have a feeling I'm gonna find him on the Leviathan's bridge!",
      "nm40aabast01080_.mp3": "Nice job, Canderous. You keep getting us out of jams like this and there might be a place for you in the Republic army, even if you are a Mandalorian!",
      "nm40aabast01082_.mp3": "You may be a droid, but when this is all over I'm going to see the Republic gives you a medal for your part in this!",
      "nm40aacart05000_.mp3": "Admiral Karath taught me everything I know about being a soldier. He was a legend in the Republic fleet, and a hero to me. Until he betrayed us.",
      "nm40aacart05002_.mp3": "When the Sith attacked my home world, the Leviathan - which is Saul Karath's flagship - was at the head of the fleet. My family was destroyed that day and my wife died in the Sith bombardment.",
      "nm40aacart05005_.mp3": "I'm not going to do anything stupid. I won't throw our lives away in some mad quest for vengeance. But if I get a chance to kill Saul during our escape, nobody better get in my way.",
      "nm40aacart05009_.mp3": "I'll admit it won't be easy. Saul's no fool and he won't underestimate us either. You can count on plenty of guards watching every move we make.",
      "nm40aacart05020_.mp3": "Well, if we're going to pick someone to save our skins we better do it quick. In another minute we're going to have Sith troops marching up our loading ramp!",
      "nm40aacart05035_.mp3": "Hold on! They're dragging us into the docking bridge!",
      "nm40aacart05040_.mp3": "Well, the droid's right. If we disable him the Sith will probably wipe his memory chips and take him to the junkpile.",
      "nm40aacart05042_.mp3": "But we can rig a back-up memory chip with a timer. When it kicks in the little fella will be reactivated and he can come find us.",
      "nm40aacart05044_.mp3": "Well, that's a risk we might have to take, unless you can come up with a better plan to get us out of this.",
      "nm40aasaul10002_.mp3": "But I recognized you, Saul. I see your face every night even as I promise myself I will kill you for what you did to my home world.",
      "nm40aasaul10006_.mp3": "It was a cowardly act of betrayal! Your fleet bombed a civilian target into oblivion without warning or provocation. And the blood of those innocent people is on your hands!",
      "nm40aasaul10010_.mp3": "My wife died in that attack, Saul. And for that, I swear I'll kill you.",
      "nm40aasaul10129_.mp3": "For the sake of the Republic don't tell him anything!",
      "nm40aasaul10139_.mp3": "No! How could you betray the Republic like this?",
      "nm40aasaul10143_.mp3": "Why? Why... why are telling him this?",
      "nm40aasaul10147_.mp3": "Words that betray the Republic bring me more pain than any torture ever could!",
      "nm40aasaul10149_.mp3": "No! Don't say anymore!",
      "nm40aasaul10154_.mp3": "My pain is meaningless! Tell him nothing!",
      "nm40aasaul10163_.mp3": "What are you saying? Physical pain is... is nothing compared to the suffering of the galaxy if Malak should defeat the Jedi!",
      "nm40aasaul10165_.mp3": "Don't waste your breath, Saul! We won't answer any of your questions.",
      "nm40absaul09002_.mp3": "The only thing you taught me was betrayal and death, Saul.",
      "nm40absaul09010_.mp3": "I've seen enough of Sith mercy!",
      "nm40absaul09018_.mp3": "It's time to finish this.",
      "nm40absaul09024_.mp3": "Don't you understand what this man has done to my life? Do you know the pain he's brought me?",
      "nm40absaul09034_.mp3": "He's gone. He said... it can't be true, can it? No. No... no - it can't! Damn you, Saul! Damn you!",
      "nm40absaul09036_.mp3": "Bastila - it is true, isn't it? And... and you knew! You and the whole damn Jedi Council. You knew the whole time!",
      "nm40absaul09040_.mp3": "So make me understand!",
      "nm40absaul09046_.mp3": "I'll trust you, Bastila but as soon as we're off this ship I expect some answers!",
      "nm40accart02010_.mp3": "NO!!",
      "nm40accart02012_.mp3": "The door's sealed, we can't get past! Come on, we have to get to the Ebon Hawk!",
      "nm40accart02014_.mp3": "Bastila doesn't stand a chance against Malak, but we can't help her. Not here. We have to get off this ship and find the Star Forge. That's the key to beating the Dark Lord! ",
      "nm40accart02016_.mp3": "Bastila sacrificed herself so we could get away. We can't let her sacrifice be in vain! Come on!",
      "nm40adcart01001_.mp3": "We ran into Malak. He would have killed us, but Bastila sacrificed herself so we could get away.",
      "nm40adcart01005_.mp3": "Not so fast. I need to know if what Malak said about you is true or not, first. You aren't... you *can't* be, can you?",
      "nm40adcart01008_.mp3": "I suppose I shouldn't be surprised by your attitude now that I know who you really are... Revan.",
      "nm40adcart01009_.mp3": "Not so fast. We've got a bigger issue to deal with here. They deserve to know the truth about you. Do you want to tell them what Malak said, or should I?",
      "nm40adcart01012_.mp3": "No, it's no joke. The Jedi Council captured Revan and erased the Dark Lord's mind, programming in a new identity. Saul Karath told me on the Leviathan and Bastila confirmed it!",
      "nm40adcart01017_.mp3": "Of course it still matters! How do we know more memories won't come flooding back? How do we know Revan won't suddenly turn on us?",
      "nm40adcart01018_.mp3": "I've been such a fool! I... I swore to protect you! And here you were the enemy all this time!",
      "nm40adcart01020_.mp3": "But... you're the one responsible for the death of my wife, the destruction of my home world! You destroyed my life!",
      "nm40adcart01021_.mp3": "How could I have been such a fool! How could I have not known?! How could you betray me like this?!",
      "nm40adcart01023_.mp3": "You should have known. I...*sigh* I should have figured it out. I just can't... was, was everything a lie, then? Everything we talked about?",
      "nm40adcart01025_.mp3": "Are you sure? I'm not sure what to believe any more. Who's to say that your old life won't come back... all of it?",
      "nm40adcart01027_.mp3": "That's what I feared. Who's to say your old life won't come back... everything you felt and thought, all of it?",
      "nm40adcart01029_.mp3": "This isn't a joke. You know what I'm talking about. I'm talking about you, about the way you felt...",
      "nm40adcart01030_.mp3": "Was the woman we knew Revan or... or someone else? Will you change into Revan? How...how can any of us trust you?",
      "nm40adcart01034_.mp3": "Get over it? Yeah... yeah, I can get over it. I should have figured out earlier you weren't what you seemed. That's my fault.",
      "nm40adcart01035_.mp3": "Do you think everybody else is going to be so quick to 'get over it'? You think they're going to follow a Sith Lord?",
      "nm40adcart01037_.mp3": "But it is true. It's horribly true! It was...it was you... you killed my wife, you ravaged my world. You...you destroyed my life!",
      "nm40adcart01039_.mp3": "It doesn't matter who's to blame. You're still the one who did it. You killed my wife... you betrayed everything that I believed in! You destroyed my life!",
      "nm40adcart01041_.mp3": "Oh, it changes everything! It was... it was you! You were the one that attacked my world! You were the one that destroyed my life!",
      "nm40adcart01042_.mp3": "The whole time we've been chasing after Malak we've had his old Sith Master right at our side; listening to our secrets; hearing our plans!",
      "nm40adcart01051_.mp3": "I don't know if I can get over it that easily, Mission. I mean... after all Revan did... how could any of us forgive her?",
      "nm40adcart01052_.mp3": "How can you say that, Mission? The Sith bombed my home world! Revan took away my family and destroyed my life!",
      "nm40adcart01094_.mp3": "Well, the others seem to trust you... and I don't see any other way that we can stop the Sith. And I suppose that Malak is the real enemy here... I really don't have any other choice, do I? ",
      "nm40adcart01096_.mp3": "I want to believe you. You've proven yourself time and time again during our mission, but this is a little much for me to wrap my mind around.",
      "nm40adcart01098_.mp3": "This must be even more of a shock to you... I don't know how you even keep going. I guess we both just have to find a way to push forward.",
      "nm40adcart01099_.mp3": "Don't worry about me - I'm a soldier. I can put aside my misgivings for now. We can, uh... we can talk later, you and I. Just give me time.",
      "nm40adcart01104_.mp3": "I see. Well, I guess that answers a lot of my questions about who you really are.",
      "nm40adcart01105_.mp3": "Don't worry - I won't let my personal feelings get in the way of my assignments or this mission. But don't forget: I've sworn an oath to defend the Republic!",
      "nm40adcart01106_.mp3": "As long as this mission stays on course I'll stick with you. But I won't let you betray the Republic under any circumstances!",
      "nm40adcart01107_.mp3": "So I guess that's it then... we keep going. We've still got one more Star Map to uncover if we're going to find that Star Forge and save Bastila, so let's do it before it's too late. ",
      "nm40adcart01109_.mp3": "I don't know. Maybe I just need time to, uh... to think about it.",
      "nm40adcart01110_.mp3": "The others seem to trust you... and we need you to stop the Sith. And I suppose Malak is the real enemy here. But I don't have much choice but to go along with this for now, do I?",
      "nm40adcart01114_.mp3": "It, uh... it all makes sense now... Revan. I've watched you, I've seen your cruelty. I've seen your... your dark side. And now this! I don't know if I can trust you. Can any of us?",
      "nm40adcart01115_.mp3": "I... I suppose you've proven yourself to be a friend of the Republic by your actions so far... Revan. But can I trust you? Can any of us?",
      "nm40adcart01117_.mp3": "And so the lies begin. It was obvious you remembered something back there when Malak confronted you with the truth. It might have only been small pieces, but there was something there!",
      "nm40adcart01120_.mp3": "Threats? You can't bully me - though I shouldn't be surprised now that I know who you really are... Revan.",
      "nm40adcart01123_.mp3": "Malak won't kill her. I think he'll want to use her battle meditation against the Republic. He'll keep her alive so he can turn her to the dark side!",
      "nm40adcart01126_.mp3": "Let's get out of here before they close those docking bay doors!",
      "nm41aabast01001_.mp3": "Safe? You saw what his fleet did to Taris: there wasn't a building over two stories high left standing! They turned the planet into one big pile of rubble.",
      "nm41aabast01005_.mp3": "Maybe you're right. It isn't easy to witness the annihilation of an entire planet. I know Mission must be taking it pretty hard.",
      "nm41aablac01002_.mp3": "Wait a minute - you understood these creatures? Of course... you and Malak must have been here before. You...you probably learned their language back when you were Revan.",
      "nm41aacart03000_.mp3": "You're back! But where's Bastila? Is she alive? What happened inside that Temple?",
      "nm41aacart03002_.mp3": "The dark side? Bastila? No! How could that happen?",
      "nm41aacart03010_.mp3": "But there's still hope for her, right? I mean, Revan rejected the dark side so Bastila could too, right? We still might be able to save her.",
      "nm41aacart03014_.mp3": "Decide? Decide what?",
      "nm41aacart03016_.mp3": "So... you did it? You turned against Revan once and for all? I knew she wasn't part of you anymore. I knew it.",
      "nm41aacart03020_.mp3": "I told you that you would have to make a choice eventually, that you would be tested. I think that was it, I can feel it.",
      "nm41aacart03021_.mp3": "And you did exactly what I'd hoped you would. It couldn't have been easy... I'm very proud of you.",
      "nm41aacart03023_.mp3": "I'm sure she did. I can't say that any one of us wouldn't have been tempted.",

      "nm41aacart03056_.mp3": "Hold on a second! What about Bastila? Wasn't she in the Temple? What happened?",
      "nm41aacart03057_.mp3": "Bastila - you're alive! I was worried about you. For a minute there I was sure we'd never see you again once Malak got his... wait a minute.",
      "nm41aacart03058_.mp3": "Where are Juhani and Jolee Bindo? Are they okay? What happened inside that temple?",
      "nm41aacart03060_.mp3": "What... what are you talking about?",
      "nm41aacart03063_.mp3": "No, you can't mean that! This... this isn't you! You're not Revan, I know it!",

      "nm41aacart03091_.mp3": "You don't have to help the Sith, Mission. Not while I'm here.",
      "nm41aacart03093_.mp3": "I won't let you do this to yourself. I... I love you. No matter what.",
      "nm41aacart03095_.mp3": "Run for it, Mission! Get to the jungle! Go! Go!",
      "nm41aacart03099_.mp3": "Run for it, Mission! Get to the jungle! Go! Go!",
      "nm41aacart03109_.mp3": "Where's Jolee Bindo? Is he okay? What happened inside that temple?",
      "nm41aacart03112_.mp3": "That disruptor field fried our stabilizers - we're lucky we made it down in one piece! But if we can't find the salvage to make repairs I won't even be able to get the Ebon Hawk airborne again!",
      "nm41aacart03117_.mp3": "Even if we get the stabilizers fixed, we'll have to find and disable the source of that disruptor field before we can take off. Otherwise we'll just end up crashing again.",
      "nm41aacart03119_.mp3": "You're right! That Sith fleet we saw must have some type of protection against the disruptor field. We have to find a way to disable it or the Republic will be slaughtered!",
      "nm41aacart03123_.mp3": "We haven't forgotten about her. But we can't do her much good stuck down here. We have to help ourselves before we can help her.",
      "nm41aacart03131_.mp3": "Well, if Bastila is on the Star Forge like you think, Jolee, then we can't rescue her until we disable that disruptor field. The sooner we investigate that temple to the east the better.",
      "nm41aacart03132_.mp3": "We can probably find the wreckage of a downed ship along the way. If we're lucky we can salvage some stabilizers from it to get off this planet.",
      "nm41aacart03139_.mp3": "The stabilizers won't do much good if we don't disable that disruptor field first. Otherwise, we'll end up crashing back down to the planet's surface again. And this time we might not survive!",

      "nm41aacart03146_.mp3": "Hey, where are you going? We can't leave the planet yet. Remember all those wrecked ships we saw?",
      "nm41aacart03147_.mp3": "We need to salvage some new stabilizers or the Ebon Hawk won't even be able to get off the ground.",
      "nm41aacart03148_.mp3": "Until we get inside that temple and find some way to disable that disruptor field, the Ebon Hawk is grounded.",
      "nm41aacart04000_.mp3": "You're back! But where's Bastila? Is she alive? What happened inside that Temple?",
      "nm41aacart04002_.mp3": "The dark side? Bastila? No! No! How could that happen?",
      "nm41aacart04003_.mp3": "She was always in danger of being seduced by the dark side, Carth. Bastila was strong, but she was always impatient and headstrong. Malak preyed upon her weaknesses.",
      "nm41aacart04004_.mp3": "This planet is a tainted place, the Star Forge and the Temple have twisted the Force into an instrument of evil - just as Malak has twisted Bastila into a servant of the Sith. ",
      "nm41aacart04006_.mp3": "Malak has a strong hold on Bastila now - it will be difficult for her to break free of his influence. Especially considering her long association with you.",
      "nm41aacart04008_.mp3": "In the end we all choose our own path, but keep in mind the role that you played in her downfall. You and the task assigned to her by the Jedi Council.",
      "nm41aacart04009_.mp3": "Remember the bond that was forged between you when she rekindled the spark that was your life. Through that bond she touched your memories... and also the echo of the dark taint within you.",
      "nm41aacart04010_.mp3": "But there's still hope for her, right? I mean, Revan rejected the dark side so Bastila could too, right? We still might be able to save her.",
      "nm41aacart04012_.mp3": "I don't know what fate awaits us, but I sense Bastila still has a role to play in the events to come. I have no doubt she will be waiting for us on the Star Forge.",
      "nm41aacart04013_.mp3": "No doubt. I must say that it's good to have you with us, my dear. For a minute there I thought you might decide... well, never mind what I thought.",
      "nm41aacart04014_.mp3": "Decide? Decide what?",
      "nm41aacart04015_.mp3": "Bastila tried to tempt her to the dark side, to reclaim Revan's heritage. She failed.",
      "nm41aacart04016_.mp3": "So... you did it? You turned against Revan once and for all? I knew she wasn't part of you anymore. I...I knew it.",
      "nm41aacart04020_.mp3": "I told you that you would have to make a choice eventually, that you would be tested. I think that was it, I...I can feel it.",
      "nm41aacart04021_.mp3": "And you did exactly what I'd hoped you would. It couldn't have been easy... I'm...I'm very proud of you.",
      "nm41aacart04023_.mp3": "I'm sure she did. I can't say that any one of us wouldn't have been tempted.",
      "nm41aacart04025_.mp3": "I know. I can't blame Bastila for being turned, however... she's...she's just so young and doesn't deserve this kind of fate.",

      "nm41aacart04030_.mp3": "Hey! Sheesh... get a room, will ya?",
      "nm41aacart04032_.mp3": "Oh, sure. Even a good omen can get itself a room, though, don't ya think?",
      "nm41aacart04034_.mp3": "Right. Sorry. I just... can't remember the last time I felt this happy. I can wait until the Star Forge is destroyed.",
      "nm41aacart04035_.mp3": "You make that sound so easy. Just fly over and boom, one less Star Forge in the universe, huh?",
      "nm41aacart04036_.mp3": "I feel more confident now than I ever did before. The Force is with us, Mission.",
      "nm41aacart04037_.mp3": "Well, I'm an old man and I know you should take love when you can find it. Good for you two, I say.",
      "nm41aacart04039_.mp3": "Answer: I have no idea what they speak of, droid. Organic meatbags are an eternal mystery to me.",
      "nm41aacart04040_.mp3": "Confidence is all well and good, Carth, but if we are going to catch up to Bastila we should leave soon, don't you think?",
      "nm41aacart04041_.mp3": "Okay - let's get moving. The longer we wait the harder this is going to be!",
      "nm41aacart04043_.mp3": "Bastila tried to tempt her to the dark side, to reclaim Revan's heritage. She failed.",
      "nm41aacart04044_.mp3": "No doubt. Let's go, then, before she has time to organize a bigger welcoming committee.",
      "nm41aacart04045_.mp3": "I'm not sure what's in store for us, but I sense Bastila still has a role to play. I have no doubt she'll be waiting for us on the Star Forge.",
      "nm41aacart04049_.mp3": "Weakness has nothing to do with the corruption of the dark side. A Jedi must always guard against pride and the desire for power. Especially you.",
      "nm41aacart04052_.mp3": "Dead? I... I can't believe it.",
      "nm41aacart04053_.mp3": "She is not dead, Carth - though maybe that might have been easier for you to accept. She has fallen to the dark side and fled to the Star Forge.",
      "nm41aacart04054_.mp3": "She's not dead, Carth - though that might have been easier for you to accept. She's fallen to the dark side and fled to the Star Forge.",

      "nm41aacart04067_.mp3": "You've got to resist it! Th... this isn't you talking... we... we can help you, we can find a way --",
      "nm41aacart04068_.mp3": "My, my. I think the sad fool may actually be in love with you, Revan.",
      "nm41aacart04071_.mp3": "No, never! You're not the woman I love. We'll stop you if we have to, all of us.",
      "nm41aacart04073_.mp3": "I refuse to believe that! We'll...we'll stop you if we have to, all of us. We'll save you from yourselves!",

      "nm41aacart04091_.mp3": "You don't have to help the Sith, Mission. Not while I'm here.",
      "nm41aacart04092_.mp3": "I see now it was a mistake to let you go into that Temple. I of all people should have seen this coming. First Saul Karath, and now you... I mean, I should be an expert on betrayal by now!",
      "nm41aacart04093_.mp3": "But nothing you can say or do can make me betray the Republic. I won't join you, and I won't just stand aside and let you become ruler of the Sith again, Revan!",
      "nm41aacart04095_.mp3": "I... I'll find a way to save you, I swear! I won't give up on you... no matter what!",
      "nm41aacart04096_.mp3": "Run for it, Mission! Go! Go!",
      "nm41aacart04098_.mp3": "Run for it, Mission! Go! Go!",
      "nm41aacart04099_.mp3": "No, Carth! Don't do it!",
      "nm41aacart04105_.mp3": "Jolee would not swear loyalty to the new ruler of the Sith. He died for his foolishness. Now swear loyalty to Darth Revan, or face your own death!",
      "nm41aacart04108_.mp3": "Where's Jolee Bindo? Is he okay? What happened inside that temple?",
      "nm41aacart04110_.mp3": "Whew! Talk about your rough landings, Carth! What's the matter? You're flying like you've been on an all night Tarisian ale drinking binge!",
      "nm41aacart04111_.mp3": "That disrupter field fried our stabilizers - we're lucky we made it down in one piece! If we can't find the salvage to make repairs I won't even be able to get the Ebon Hawk airborne again!",
      "nm41aacart04112_.mp3": "You know, during our rather rapid descent I noticed the hulls of many crashed ships scattered across the landscape. Perhaps the parts you need can be found among their wreckage.",
      "nm41aacart04113_.mp3": "The Cathar's right: this planet's a technological graveyard. I saw dozens of downed ships out there. That disrupter field must have wiped them all out. But where could it be coming from?",
      "nm41aacart04114_.mp3": "During our rather rapid descent I noticed the hulls of many crashed ships scattered across the landscape. Maybe the parts you need can be found among their wreckage.",

      "nm41aacart04122_.mp3": "We haven't forgotten about her. But we can't do her much good stuck down here. We have to help ourselves before we can help her.",
      "nm41aacart04123_.mp3": "I only hope we're not too late. Bastila has been Malak's prisoner for a long time. If he can turn her to the dark side she will join him and the Sith will be invincible.",
      "nm41aacart04125_.mp3": "I fear Bastila will find the lure of the dark side difficult to resist. She is strong in the Force, but she is also impulsive, willful and proud - as you once were, Revan.",
      "nm41aacart04127_.mp3": "I am glad to hear you say that. Now that you know your true identity I was afraid you might slip back over to the dark side. If Bastila feels as you do there may yet be hope for her.",
      "nm41aacart04129_.mp3": "Let us hope it does not come to that.",
      "nm41aacart04130_.mp3": "Well, if Bastila is on the Star Forge like you think, Jolee, then we can't rescue her until we disable that disrupter field. The sooner we investigate that temple to the east the better.",

      "nm41aacart04135_.mp3": "I remember... though I hoped you would not be so quick to embrace the being you once were. If Bastila feels as you do then she is lost to us, Revan.",
      "nm41aacart04136_.mp3": "I just hope we're not too late. Bastila's been Malak's prisoner for a long time. If he turns her to the dark side she'll join him and the Sith will become invincible.",

      "nm41aastar03002_.mp3": "I'm transmitting these co-ordinates to Admiral Dodonna. Maybe a quick strike by the Republic can cripple the Sith fleet. ",
      "nm41aastar03003_.mp3": "Message is away. We should probably wait for the Republic fleet to show up before we try and rescue Bastila. We'll need cover if we want to fly in and dock on the Star Forge.",
      "nm41aastar03004_.mp3": "We've got company... a small vanguard of Sith fighters, coming in hard! Get on those gun turrets! Take those fighters out before they report our position to the main fleet!",
      "nm41aastar03006_.mp3": "No, it's something else. We've flown into some kind of disruptor field. All my instruments are jammed... we've got massive overloads on all systems!",

      "nm45aacart02001_.mp3": "Soon the Republic fleet will break through and the capital ships will be able to bombard the Star Forge. Then it will finally be over.",
      "nm45aacart02003_.mp3": "There's no point. There's no other place I'd rather be than here.",
      "nm45aacart02005_.mp3": "You know that can't happen. There's no turning back for you... there's just an ending.",
      "nm45aacart02007_.mp3": "It's the only way. The only alternative is a path I know you don't want to take.",
      "nm45aacart02008_.mp3": "You're very brave to make the decision you did. I... I love you. You know that, right?",
      "nm45aacart02011_.mp3": "There isn't much time. It should be over soon.",
      "nm45aacart02013_.mp3": "This is all the time we have. It should all be over soon.",
      "nm45aacart02014_.mp3": "We have to kill her! Her Battle Meditation is the only thing stopping the fleet from getting through!",
      "nm45aacart02015_.mp3": "There you are! What happened?",
      "nm45aacart02018_.mp3": "That's great news! I knew you could do it!",

      "nm45aacart02027_.mp3": "So you killed Darth Malak. Somehow I... I always knew you would.",
      "nm45aacart02031_.mp3": "The Republic fleet picked me up from the planet. I told them of your betrayal... but I also told them I couldn't abandon you.",
      "nm45aacart02032_.mp3": "I had to come. I said I'd find a way to save you from yourself, and I will.",
      "nm45aacart02034_.mp3": "I don't believe that. I don't think you do, either.",
      "nm45aacart02036_.mp3": "And abandon you? No, I couldn't have done that.",
      "nm45aacart02038_.mp3": "All you have to do is listen to me. That's all I ask.",
      "nm45aacart02040_.mp3": "Don't interfere, Bastila. This is between me and Revan.",
      "nm45aacart02044_.mp3": "I love you. Even now. Even after... after...after all you have done. I love you like I haven't loved anyone or anything since my wife died. And I didn't even think that was possible.",
      "nm45aacart02045_.mp3": "You may not love me. You may not love anything anymore now that you've gone over to the dark side... but I believe that there's still some part of you I can reach.",

      "nm45aacart02049_.mp3": "No, it's too late for that. And it's too late for you to turn back... but you can end this here. There's still time for one final act of redemption.",
      "nm45aacart02050_.mp3": "Kill Bastila. Without her Battle Meditation the Republic fleet can destroy the Star Forge and rid the galaxy of this evil.",
      "nm45aacart02052_.mp3": "Stay here on the Star Forge. With me. We won't have time to get off before the Star Forge is destroyed, not if you stop Bastila. But our sacrifice can save the Republic.",
      "nm45aacart02053_.mp3": "If you don't, all you'll have is...is emptiness and darkness. You don't want that. Please don't want that. Stay... let's end this now. Together.",

      "nm02adsarn07078_.mp3": "Back again? Didn't I make myself clear enough? The senior Sith officers don't like us fraternizing with locals. Besides, I don't need you lecturing me for my career choice.",
      "nm02adsarn07080_.mp3": "Good. Move along and leave me alone or I might have to run you in for questioning.",
      "nm02adsarn07082_.mp3": "Hi there - I haven't seen you around before. Of course they don't give us Sith officers from the military base much time off...",
      "nm02adsarn07084_.mp3": "I'm off duty right now, so I'm not in uniform. My name is Sarna - junior officer first class with the Sith occupation force.",
      "nm02adsarn07086_.mp3": "I'm actually a little surprised you're talking to me at all... most of the people here on Taris can't stand us Sith. It can make this a pretty lonely job.",
      "nm02adsarn07088_.mp3": "[Success] That's true, but people don't appreciate what we've done for them. We could have slapped a curfew on this whole planet, but we didn't.",
      "nm02adsarn07090_.mp3": "[Failure] Save the sympathetic best friend act. I'm not buying it.\n",
      "nm02adsarn07092_.mp3": "But I don't want to fill out a bunch of paperwork on my day off, so let's just pretend this conversation never happened. Now move along.",
      "nm02adsarn07095_.mp3": "Oh, great... I can see where this is going: the Sith are evil; why did I join them; blah, blah, blah. I don't need a lecture from the likes of you. ",
      "nm02adsarn07097_.mp3": "Ah, it's okay. I might have overreacted a bit. But can you blame me? Everywhere I look I see one of you Tarisians glaring at me with hate in your eyes.",
      "nm02adsarn07099_.mp3": "Don't try to analyze me. I'm just doing my job - same as any other soldier in any other army. Besides, I don't have to explain myself to you!",
      "nm02adsarn07101_.mp3": "I don't think we have much else to say to each other. Let's keep this civil and go our separate ways, okay?",
      "nm02adsarn07104_.mp3": "You're an off-worlder? Huh, I figured you'd be even more angry, being stuck on a foreign planet and all.",
      "nm02adsarn07107_.mp3": "You know, it's like everyone on this backwater planet is in a permanent bad mood. Don't they know they have to make the best of things?",
      "nm02adsarn07109_.mp3": "Exactly! It's all about attitude. I didn't ask to be assigned to this backwater planet, but I try to make the best of it!",
      "nm02adsarn07111_.mp3": "It's pretty easy to get depressed on an assignment like this, but we do what we can to keep our spirits up.",
      "nm02adsarn07113_.mp3": "That's true. It's nice to meet someone who understands what I'm going through. It's good to talk about this stuff - it gets pretty lonely up at the military base.",
      "nm02adsarn07115_.mp3": "I have to get going soon - I've got a shift at the military base. But some of us junior Sith officers are having a party tonight to blow off some steam.",
      "nm02adsarn07117_.mp3": "I'd really like to see you again. Why don't you drop by the party? I'll show you where it is on your map.",
      "nm02adsarn07119_.mp3": "Don't worry - you won't be the only civilian there. A few of the locals who don't hate us are going to show up, too. I hope to see you there. ",
      "nm02adsarn07125_.mp3": "First you come over and say hi, then you scurry off as soon as you find out I'm a Sith soldier. You Tarisians are a funny bunch.",
      "nm02aechil04000_.mp3": "You ain't supposed to be here! This ain't your home!",
      "nm02aesarn29000_.mp3": "Hey, you made it! I was beginning to wonder if you were going to show! The party's in full swing - come on in.",
      "nm02aesarn29001_.mp3": "You have to try this Tarisian ale - it's fantastic! We should have conquered this planet ages ago!",
      "nm02aesarn29003_.mp3": "Who cares? We're not on duty tomorrow - let's live a little! Come on - drink up!",
      "nm02aesarn29004_.mp3": "I'm surprised to see you again. I thought you had gotten sick of me complaining about my job at the Sith military base. I guess I kind of obsess about it. That can't be healthy.",
      "nm02aesarn29005_.mp3": "Well, are you here to close our deal? 200 credits gets you access to a set of Sith uniforms. Otherwise, we really shouldn't be talking.",
      "nm02aesarn29006_.mp3": "Sorry, but I'm not here looking for conversation. I just came to get a drink, listen to some music and try to relax before my next shift at the military base.",
      "nm02aesarn29008_.mp3": "I don't wear my uniform when I'm off duty. It's not allowed. In fact, anyone in uniform is banned from entering the cantina.",
      "nm02aesarn29009_.mp3": "The officers don't even like it when we show up here off duty. Don't like us fraternizing with the locals, I guess. But it gets pretty stale hanging around the base all the time.",
      "nm02aesarn29010_.mp3": "Besides, the Sith don't own me. Being a soldier in their fleet is just a job, you know? A job with long hours and low pay, I might add. ",
      "nm02aesarn29012_.mp3": "When I signed up I was promised adventure and excitement in exotic locales. Instead, I end up stationed at a military base on some backwater planet on the fringes of the galaxy.",
      "nm02aesarn29013_.mp3": "If I could just find some other way to earn some credits I could give this lousy job up. Retire my uniform, so to speak.",
      "nm02aesarn29015_.mp3": "Back at the military base, of course. I keep it there when I'm off duty. If anything happens to it they dock the cost from my pay.",
      "nm02aesarn29017_.mp3": "What? Are you offering me a bribe? You realize this is treason, right? If I report you the Sith will have you executed!",
      "nm02aesarn29019_.mp3": "Hey, now - let's not start making threats. I didn't say I *would* report you, only that I could. This kind of talk is dangerous, you know? But I'm not going to turn you in.",
      "nm02aesarn29021_.mp3": "The truth is I find your offer rather tempting. I could probably get you some uniforms. But if we get caught we're dead. You're asking me to take an awful risk.",
      "nm02aesarn29022_.mp3": "If I'm going to do this, it's going to cost you. 200 credits up front if you want some uniforms. No more, no less. So how about it - we have a deal?",
      "nm02aesarn29025_.mp3": "[Success] Hmmm... 100 credits is a small fortune. I'll never have the chance to make that much in one shot again.",
      "nm02aesarn29026_.mp3": "Okay, you've got a deal. The trick is to get you the uniforms without the Sith knowing I gave them to you. But I've got a plan.",
      "nm02aesarn29027_.mp3": "I'm going to a party with some of the other Sith soldiers tonight. You show up and I'll make sure everyone else gets good and drunk. When we pass out you can take our uniforms.",
      "nm02aesarn29029_.mp3": "I'll probably get a reprimand for not locking it up, but that's about it. Then, in another month I'll resign and retire with all those credits you gave me.",
      "nm02aesarn29030_.mp3": "Here - I'll add the address of the party to your datapad. Show up there later. To be on the safe side we shouldn't speak again before or after the party.",
      "nm02aesarn29031_.mp3": "I'll go make all the arrangements and I'll see you at the party tonight. Just remember - if you get caught with those uniforms, I don't know you.",
      "nm02aesarn29033_.mp3": "We're in this together now. If either one of us goes to the Sith we'll both end up in the torture chambers. Anyway, it's not like you have a choice.",
      "nm02aesarn29034_.mp3": "I'm not giving you your credits back, so you might as well show up at the party later and take the uniforms after we all get drunk and pass out. What could be more simple?",
      "nm02aesarn29036_.mp3": "[Failure] Look, I'm not going to risk my neck unless I get a big payday. 200 credits or no deal.",
      "nm02aesarn29038_.mp3": "Sorry to hear that, but I won't put my neck on the line for nothing! Tell you what - you come up with the credits and we can talk. Otherwise, no deal.",
      "nm02aesarn29041_.mp3": "You... you weren't serious? Oh... okay. Although if you *were* serious, we might be able to work something out. No - wait! Forget I said that! We shouldn't be talking like this.",
      "nm02aesarn29042_.mp3": "I might complain a lot, but it's a big step from complaining to treason. I think... I think maybe we should end this conversation - for both our sakes.",
      "nm02aesarn29044_.mp3": "The senior officers don't really like it when we start answering questions, you know? They don't want us fraternizing with the locals. Just another \"perk\" of the job.",
      "nm02aesarn29045_.mp3": "No offense, but I probably shouldn't be talking to you anymore. I'm just going to say something that might get me in trouble.",
      "nm02aesarn29047_.mp3": "Oh... okay. See you around. Say, do me a favor and don't repeat all the stuff I just told you. It might not go over well with my superiors.",
      "nm02aesarn29049_.mp3": "Hey, there. I didn't think we'd be chatting again so soon. You took off on me pretty quick last time.",
      "nm02aesarn29050_.mp3": "Back again? Didn't I make myself clear enough? The senior Sith officers don't like us fraternizing with the locals. Besides, I don't need you lecturing me for my career choice.",

      "nm17ag10cz01048_.mp3": "I'm sure. Czerka Corporation thanks you again.",
      "nm17ag10cz01050_.mp3": "[Success] It would be valuable to have someone on call if the Sand People made another incursion. I think you're right.",

      "nm17ag10cz01055_.mp3": "[Success] And I wouldn't want you to leave without this additional reward. Yes, of course I wouldn't.",
      "nm17ag10cz01057_.mp3": "Once again, Czerka Corporation thanks you.",
      "nm17ag10cz01059_.mp3": "*ahem* While I respect your... forcefulness, I must remind you that ours are the finest, and only, guards in Anchorhead.",
      "nm17ag10cz01061_.mp3": "It would simply be inadvisable to attempt such an action in here. There would be no place for you to run. I don't fear you here.",
      "nm17ag10cz01065_.mp3": "As I said, we are no longer selling them. There are too many people cavorting about outside the walls as it is.",
      "nm17ag10cz01069_.mp3": "We don't allow casual exploration because of legal concerns. Czerka Corporation takes no responsibility for loss of life on the dunes.",
      "nm17ag10cz01073_.mp3": "Well, normally we charge 200 credits, but I could make an exception if you agreed to perform a task for us. It's similar to hunting.",
      "nm17ag10cz01075_.mp3": "The Sand People are becoming a problem. They destroy our sandcrawlers and kill our miners. One particular tribe is the worst.",
      "nm17ag10cz01077_.mp3": "It's as if their chieftain has decided to wage a war against us. I would like their attacks... terminated. Bring me their gaffi sticks as proof.",
      "nm17ag10cz01079_.mp3": "If you agree to do this, I'll give you a hunting license now and pay a bounty for each stick later. I'll give a bonus for the chieftain's.",
      "nm17ag10cz01083_.mp3": "Then you are free to not leave the city, just like everyone else. Czerka Corporation will welcome your eventual change of mind.",
      "nm17ag10cz01085_.mp3": "Please, feel free to enjoy the door behind you.",
      "nm17ag10cz01087_.mp3": "Excellent. Now, just so we understand each other, this is an enforceable contract. Czerka Corporation takes this very seriously.",
      "nm17ag10cz01089_.mp3": "Here is your license, and a few directions. We believe one of their enclaves is in the far south of the Dune Sea.",
      "nm17ag10cz01091_.mp3": "You might try following one of our sandcawlers. They are regularly attacked. I wouldn't mind you escorting them.",
      "nm17ag10cz01093_.mp3": "Very good. Czerka Corporation looks forward to your future business.",
      "nm17ag10cz01098_.mp3": "The last license issued before the ban was given to a woman named Marlena Venn. She'll do fine; she had a mean streak a parsec wide.",
      "nm17ag10cz01100_.mp3": "She also paid double. Exceptions like this are rare, unless it suits the company to offer them.",

      "nm17ag10cz01107_.mp3": "Yes, we are still waiting for you to return with the Sand People Chieftain's gaffi stick. I will reward you well when you do.",
      "nm17ag10cz01111_.mp3": "And I would remind you that you did agree to do this task for Czerka Corporation. We expect completion in a timely manner.",
      "nm17ag10cz01113_.mp3": "I should remind you that you were not retained as a diplomatic representative. You are a hunter, and should go after your prey as we agreed.",
      "nm17ag10cz01119_.mp3": "For your needs here, we maintain a fully stocked storehouse. Speak with Greeta Holda about any purchases.",
      "nm17ag10cz01121_.mp3": "I'm sorry, but day-to-day operations of Czerka Corporation outposts are fully regionalized. I have no information on Kashyyyk.",
      "nm17ag10cz01125_.mp3": "Certainly. Please pose your questions to the Representative Kiosk on Coruscant. Business hours please.",
      "nm17ag10cz01127_.mp3": "[Success] I suppose you're right. It's not like you can't tell the state of things just by looking around.",
      "nm17ag10cz01129_.mp3": "Mining operations here have not been a success. The ore is substandard, and there's less of it than surveys indicated.",
      "nm17ag10cz01131_.mp3": "With the Sand People raids on top of it all, it's no wonder this planet has been abandoned before.",
      "nm17ag10cz01139_.mp3": "The company would have to be foolish to stay. It will be costly, but in the end, leaving will be cheaper than staying.",
      "nm17ag10cz01141_.mp3": "I imagine all the heavy equipment will be abandoned. It's not worth shipping out things like sandcrawlers.",
      "nm17ag10cz01143_.mp3": "Maybe the Jawas will find a use for them when we're gone. Ha! That's a laugh!",
      "nm17ag10cz01149_.mp3": "The Jawas scavenge ancient tech all the time. It's a remote world. Who knows what's here?",
      "nm17ag10cz01155_.mp3": "I assume that by \"out of the ordinary\" you are referring to the destruction of Taris? That is all anyone is talking about.",
      "nm17ag10cz01157_.mp3": "I'm afraid Czerka Corporation is not offering any comment on those events. We wouldn't wish to anger the participants.",
      "nm17ag10cz01167_.mp3": "Farewell. Czerka Corporation welcomes your future inquiries.",
      "nm17ag10cz01168_.mp3": "Hello again. I hear you've made an impression down at the swoop track. Czerka Corporation wholly supports local events."

      "nm02ackebl04015_.mp3": "Ah, just so you know, the prices on the items are final - no bargaining here. This isn't a swap meet, ok? I only deal in top notch stuff.",
      "nm02ackebl04017_.mp3": "Because of the Sith quarantine I haven't been able to stock any new inventory, but I've still got some nice items you might be interested in.",
      "nm02ackebl04020_.mp3": "Anything I can do to help a potential customer out. What do you want to know?",
      "nm02ackebl04022_.mp3": "I heard a couple of pods crashed down in the Undercity. I bet the crash sites have already been stripped clean by the Sith though - unless the swoop gangs or Davik's men got there first.",
      "nm02ackebl04024_.mp3": "Uh, heh. It's not smart to say bad things about the people in power, if you get my meaning. I just wish the Sith would ease up on the quarantine - they're killing my business!",
      "nm02ackebl04026_.mp3": "I can't say I like having them here in the Upper City, but it could be worse. And we're still a lot better off than the Lower City, what with those swoop gangs and all.",
      "nm02ackebl04028_.mp3": "Oh, you're one of those off-worlders, arent you? Come to Taris for a short business trip and end up stuck here because of the Sith quarantine, right?",
      "nm02ackebl04030_.mp3": "Oh, you can't be too happy, trapped on an unfamiliar world and all. But Taris isn't so bad, as long as you stay in the Upper City. Just try to avoid the Sith.",
      "nm02ackebl04032_.mp3": "And stay out of the Lower City. The swoop gangs are totally out of control. Even Davik's men are having trouble down there. ",

      "nm02ackebl04036_.mp3": "Things weren't so bad when the Hidden Beks were running the show, but ever since the rise of the Black Vulkar gang the Lower City has been nothing short of a war zone!",
      "nm02ackebl04038_.mp3": "The Sith haven't even bothered trying to maintain order down there, and I heard a rumor that Davik's own people are having problems with the Black Vulkars now.",
      "nm02ackebl04040_.mp3": "Oh, Davik's a legitimate businessman, if you get my drift: smuggling, slaving, extortion. Uh huh. They say he's a member of the Exchange - you know, the big intergalactic criminal organization.",
      "nm02ackebl04044_.mp3": "I have to pay him a protection fee every month, but it's reasonable. And I get most of my inventory through Davik and his suppliers - I'm just smart enough not to ask where it came from, you understand?",
      "nm02ackebl04046_.mp3": "Careful where you say that. Davik's got spies and agents everywhere. Besides, he's as much a part of Taris as the skyscrapers or the swoop gangs.",
      "nm02ackebl04048_.mp3": "Davik hates the Sith as much as anybody - the quarantine has put a real dent in his operations too. But he's keeping a low profile as long as the occupation lasts.",
      "nm02ackebl04050_.mp3": "Davik stays out of the way, and the Sith don't bother him. The swoop gangs could learn a thing or two from this tidy little arrangement, instead of always going after each other.",
      "nm02ackebl04052_.mp3": "Oh well, see you around, then. Unless Bendak takes care of you first. Uh, good luck with that, by the way.",

      "nm02ackebl04059_.mp3": "Hey, look who's back - the Mysterious Stranger! You know, I had a front row seat when you gunned down Bendak Starkiller. Best duel I've ever seen!",
      "nm02ackebl04061_.mp3": "If times weren't so tough I'd give you a discount, seeing as how you're a big celebrity and all. But with the Sith occupation I can barely afford to keep the doors open. ",

      "nm13aayuth22010_.mp3": "The Council said they would give me time to decide if I wanted to try again, if I was ready. I don't know. There's... there's so much that I've done.",
      "nm13aayuth22012_.mp3": "Yes. Part of me just wants to forget it, to put it behind me... but that isn't right, either. I have to accept it and move on.",
      "nm13aayuth22014_.mp3": "I suppose I have. It's still tempting, all that power... but I've had my fill of it and it wasn't enough.",
      "nm13aayuth22016_.mp3": "I suppose I owe it to you, and to myself, to give the Jedi another chance. I'm not the foolish young girl I once was.",
      "nm13aayuth22018_.mp3": "It's not that easy for me. There's an... an ache inside me I just can't seem to quench.",
      "nm13aayuth22019_.mp3": "My old master said he would start exercises with me again... slowly, when I was ready. He said my experience with the dark side could make me a very wise Jedi.",
      "nm13aayuth22020_.mp3": "There is no emotion; there is peace. There is no ignorance; there is knowledge. There is no passion; there is serenity. There is no chaos; there is harmony. There is no death; there is the Force.",
      "nm13aayuth22021_.mp3": "Those words never held such resonance for me until I returned. I'd... like some serenity, some harmony. Wouldn't you?",
      "nm13aayuth22023_.mp3": "Yes, I suppose your fate still has much in store for you, just as I saw back on Korriban.",
      "nm13aayuth22025_.mp3": "Then may the Force be with you, my friend. I hope we will see each other again.",
      "nm13aayuth22027_.mp3": "That's too bad. A little serenity might be useful considering the fate you have in store for you.",
      "nm13aayuth22029_.mp3": "I don't know. I doubt it. Even if I wanted to, the Sith would never take me back. To them, I am a traitor.",
      "nm13aayuth22030_.mp3": "But the dark side... that's a different matter. The dark side is not the Sith. I still feel its temptation strongly.",
      "nm13aayuth22031_.mp3": "My emotions are so strong. Just the other day I nearly attacked a poor Padawan for tripping into me, nearly berated his clumsiness and weakness.",
      "nm13aayuth22032_.mp3": "I didn't, thankfully, but it's difficult to fight off those feelings. How do you do it?",
      "nm13aayuth22034_.mp3": "And to think I took my advice to come here from you. Ha ha! Perhaps you should follow your own counsel sometime.",
      "nm13aayuth22036_.mp3": "That's the worst thing to hear... how hard it is. I suppose that's the honest answer. The dark side is the easier path for a reason.",
      "nm13aayuth22039_.mp3": "You jest, but I think I know how you really feel.",
      "nm13aayuth22040_.mp3": "The one thing that made me come here was how hard I had to think to remember where I began and where Yuthura the Sith Master ended.",
      "nm13aayuth22041_.mp3": "That wasn't the person I wanted to be, so how did I end up there? It... it will take some time for me to sort through that, I think.",
      "nm13aayuth22043_.mp3": "You know, I'd forgotten all about that until I spoke to you about it on Korriban. Strange, considering my hate for them is what made me leave the Jedi.",
      "nm13aayuth22044_.mp3": "I think... I think I've got to help myself, first, before I can help anyone else.",
      "nm13aayuth22045_.mp3": "Maybe once that happens, I can work with the Jedi to make a difference. They may work slowly, but they do make a difference, don't they?",
      "nm13aayuth22047_.mp3": "More than the Sith did. The Sith bring more misery than the slavers ever did... I don't know why I didn't see that before.",
      "nm13aayuth22050_.mp3": "You believe that? I believe that they're better than the Sith. The Sith bring more misery than the slavers ever did. I don't know why I didn't see that before.",
      "nm13aayuth22051_.mp3": "I may not be able to change everything at once like I wanted to... but it would feel good to really help someone, for a change.",
      "nm13aayuth22052_.mp3": "Maybe that's a reason to change. Maybe that's a reason to stay. I... I guess I'll see.",
      "nm13aayuth22054_.mp3": "That's... very tempting.",
      "nm13aayuth22055_.mp3": "But I'm not ready to leave here, yet. And I don't belong on the path you have to take... I told you that on Korriban. It's still true.",
      "nm13aayuth22056_.mp3": "But... perhaps you could come back, afterwards. I could certainly use a friend, then.",
      "nm13aayuth22058_.mp3": "That's good. I look forward to that time. Perhaps we can travel together, then.",
      "nm13aayuth22060_.mp3": "I know. I can... see that about you. I'm not sure that we will meet again. Still... I can hope that is the case.",
      "nm13aayuth22062_.mp3": "Oh. Well, that's too bad. I'm still grateful for what you've done for me, regardless.",

      "nm20aa09ch02011_.mp3": "Translation: He plans to move his people farther from Anchorhead, but they need to build up stores of water first. He says you must aid him.",
      "nm20aa09ch02012_.mp3": "Translation: He wants moisture vaporators from the Czerka. If you deliver them, he will order that his people reduce their attacks on miners.",
      "nm20aa09ch02015_.mp3": "Translation: Hmph. He does not believe you, master. We will only be allowed to reenter the enclave when we have the vaporators with us.",
      "nm20aa09ch02016_.mp3": "Translation: We are to be escorted outside. He will wait, but he doesn't believe we are coming back.",
      "nm20aa09ch02019_.mp3": "Translation: He says that will never happen, master. Ignorant outsiders continually desecrate their most reverential customs. This will always demand a response... an attitude I can respect.",
      "nm20aa09ch02020_.mp3": "Protocol: From his perspective, a reduction is already a large step. It is doubtful you will get agreement on much more than that.",
      "nm20aa09ch02023_.mp3": "Translation: He says you will get no more answers until you have proven you are an ally of the Sand People.",
      "nm20aa09ch02026_.mp3": "Translation: He refuses to waste breath on you until you are proven to be an ally of his people. He seems quite adamant about it. Please let me blast him, master!",
      "nm20aa09ch02029_.mp3": "Agreement: That is probably the most efficient course of action. This will be enjoyable.",
      "nm20aa09ch02031_.mp3": "Protocol: While I enjoy the prospect, master, are you certain that is wise? He will not react favorably.",
      "nm20aa09ch02035_.mp3": "Translation: The results were predictable. He says we have tainted this place by being here and have insulted his leadership.",
      "nm20aa09ch02036_.mp3": "Translation: And something about your parentage and a grub worm, but he won't repeat it. Prepare for battle, master.",
      "nm20aa09ch02038_.mp3": "Extrapolation: I understand that you are Force Sensitive, master, but I lack sufficient knowledge to make an accurate assumption.",
      "nm20aa09ch02039_.mp3": "Hypothesis: Perhaps your ability does not take the place of actual language study when the subject is out of the ordinary.",
      "nm20aa09ch02040_.mp3": "Or perhaps the Sand People confuse your ability because they actively refuse to communicate with most outsiders. I have no data on this, sadly.",
      "nm20aa09ch02043_.mp3": "Query: What do you wish to ask of him, master?",
      "nm20aa09ch02046_.mp3": "Translation: He says that what you seek is far from here, in the Eastern Dune Sea. He will give you a map so you can find your way.",
      "nm20aa09ch02047_.mp3": "Translation: His people found it, but didn't scavenge it because a krayt dragon took up residence in the excavation.",
      "nm20aa09ch02050_.mp3": "Translation: He says that he is not responsible for the failure of your eyes. The thing that you seek is in the rear of the krayt lair.",
      "nm20aa09ch02053_.mp3": "Translation: Your ignorance isn't his concern. He claims there is a hunter that wanders the area sometimes, and that you should ask him.",
      "nm20aa09ch02054_.mp3": "Translation: The hunter is a Twi'lek. He will be in the Eastern Dune Sea somewhere.",
      "nm20aa09ch02056_.mp3": "Agreement: My thoughts exactly, master. One dead organic meatbag, coming up.",
      "nm20aa09ch02057_.mp3": "Translation: He says that you already have a map to the Eastern Dune Sea, where we will find the Star Map.",
      "nm20aa09ch02059_.mp3": "Clarification: We must be more specific, master. They capture many organics.",
      "nm20aa09ch02062_.mp3": "Translation: He says that the captive Jawas are slaves and that have lived past their usefulness. You may take them, if you wish.",
      "nm20aa09ch02066_.mp3": "Translation: He says that by his very presence, this Griff defiles their home and land. He is without any semblance of usefulness to them.",
      "nm20aa09ch02067_.mp3": "Yup. That would be Griff.",
      "nm20aa09ch02068_.mp3": "Extrapolation: I would assume we are free to take him. It is doubtful they will even waste the effort to kill him. Perhaps we could do it, master?",
      "nm20aa09ch02071_.mp3": "Protocol: We should not keep him long. It is an insult to take too much of his time. Unless the plan is to blast him when you are done, of course.",
      "nm20aa09ch02073_.mp3": "Protocol: This will be a very sensitive topic, master. You will want to be careful with your questions or risk offending him. Not that that is much of a worry.",
      "nm20aa09ch02076_.mp3": "Translation: He says you may listen to the Storyteller, but if you dare to say the histories incorrectly, they will have you killed.",
      "nm20aa09ch02078_.mp3": "Translation: You have been told that to be considered worthy of hearing the histories, you need to bring him a dragon pearl from a krayt dragon.",
      "nm20aa09ch02079_.mp3": "Translation: He says the discussion is closed until you fulfill this condition. He thinks you are just making fun of his traditions.",
      "nm20aa09ch02081_.mp3": "Translation: He says that he will not, master. There is one Storyteller in each clan, and only he may recite the histories.",
      "nm20aa09ch02084_.mp3": "Translation: He says that you don't understand. They must never be told to someone who might say them incorrectly out of ignorance.",
      "nm20aa09ch02085_.mp3": "Translation: To speak them in error is a blasphemy punishable by death. Only their greatest warriors are even permitted to listen to the tales.",
      "nm20aa09ch02088_.mp3": "Translation: He won't believe you until he sees a dragon pearl as proof. I should kill him for not taking you at your word, master.",
      "nm20aa09ch02091_.mp3": "Translation: He is stupefied, master. He never thought you could return with such an item. Such a thing has not been done in many years.",
      "nm20aa09ch02092_.mp3": "Translation: He will allow you to meet the Storyteller, but also gives a warning: if you dare to repeat the histories incorrectly, you will be killed.",
      "nm20aa09ch02093_.mp3": "Translation: The Storyteller will be summoned to one of the rooms here in the enclave. He seems to think this is a great honor for you, master.",
      "nm20aa09ch02096_.mp3": "Translation: He doesn't know, master. His people usually kill outsiders. Since you are an outsider yourself, that would not suffice.",
      "nm20aa09ch02097_.mp3": "Translation: The greatest challenge for a warrior is to face a krayt dragon, the largest predator on Tatooine. Fight one of those and bring back a dragon pearl.",
      "nm20aa09ch02098_.mp3": "Disgust: I think he's making fun of you, master. He doesn't believe an outsider could do such a thing.",
      "nm20aa09ch02101_.mp3": "Translation: There is a dragon in the far Eastern Dune Sea, but he claims you could never defeat it. Here is a map to the area.",
      "nm20aa09ch02102_.mp3": "Translation: There is a hunter, a Twi'lek, that is sometimes seen out there. Perhaps he would be of some help.",
      "nm20aa09ch02103_.mp3": "Translation: He says there is a dragon in the Eastern Dune Sea that you could sacrifice yourself to. You already have a map to the area.",
      "nm20aa09ch02106_.mp3": "Translation: Stones polished in the gullet of the beast. Apparently they are valuable items.",
      "nm20aa09ch02109_.mp3": "Translation: He says that the fact that you have to ask this is just one more example of your ignorance as an outsider, master. He says you are blind.",
      "nm20aa09ch02110_.mp3": "Translation: His people believe they are part of the land, living with it. You and your kind dare to raise yourself above it. You remove yourself.",
      "nm20aa09ch02111_.mp3": "Translation: That act of removal makes you an outsider, separate from all that is important. You could never understand how unwelcome you are.",
      "nm20aa09ch02114_.mp3": "Translation: He says that outsiders use machines to convey them, and to make their lives easier. This severs a connection with the land.",
      "nm20aa09ch02115_.mp3": "Translation: Connection to the soil must be made through flesh. A sacred animal is the only external tool to be used.",
      "nm20aa09ch02118_.mp3": "Translation: He says that the use of these blasphemous things will only be tolerated because outsider interference has forced it upon them. ",
      "nm20aa09ch02119_.mp3": "Translation: If your kind had not come here, he would not have to defend their ways or their land.",
      "nm20aa09ch02122_.mp3": "Translation: He says that the robes are sacred, master, and you would not understand. Sand People are never uncovered outside of the most private moments.",
      "nm20aa09ch02125_.mp3": "Translation: Never. That is their way, master.",
      "nm20aa09ch02127_.mp3": "Protocol: Is that wise, master? They may have assumed that the disguises you used were replicas instead of being taken off their dead.",
      "nm20aa09ch02130_.mp3": "Translation: The result is predictable. You have desecrated their dead. Happily, it seems the peace is over. It is time to kill.",
      "nm20aa09ch02133_.mp3": "Translation: We are free to leave.",
      "nm20aa09ch02139_.mp3": "Translation: He did not expect us to return, master. He wonders if we have brought the moisture vaporators.",
      "nm20aa09ch02142_.mp3": "Translation: He does not trust you, master, but you have done more than any other outsider. They will not attack, and he grants you his Chieftain's Gaffi as reward.",
      "nm20aa09ch02143_.mp3": "Translation: The attacks will be reduced, and he will allow you to explore this enclave, but be warned that any lack of respect will result in death.",
      "nm20aa09ch02145_.mp3": "Protocol: If you truly want this sadly peaceful arrangement to continue, be careful of what you ask.",
      "nm20aa09ch02147_.mp3": "Commentary: Thank you, master. This should be fun.",
      "nm20aa09ch02150_.mp3": "Translation: He says that he has made his offer and there will be no further negotiation, master. Deliver the vaporators or face death. Shall I blast him now?",
      "nm20aa09ch02152_.mp3": "Query: Is that wise, master? You went through the trouble of acquiring the vaporators, after all... not that I would mind a battle.",
      "nm20aa09ch02154_.mp3": "Conciliatory: I was not refusing, master. Quite the contrary, initiating attack sequence now!",
      "nm20aa09fi03002_.mp3": "Interjection: One moment... I believe I understood that, master. It may not have been his intention, but he did actually communicate something.",
      "nm20aa09fi03006_.mp3": "Result: I believe I have succeeded in confusing him, master. We have shown an interest not common among outsiders.",
      "nm20aa09fi03010_.mp3": "Translation: He is expressing disbelief... as am I... but his duty requires that he report to the Chieftain.",
      "nm20aa09fi03012_.mp3": "Extrapolation: It would seem that we are at least worthy of curiosity, for the moment. I would much rather this get bloody, master, but it is your call.",
      "nm20aa09fi03017_.mp3": "Cautionary: Not the most productive of results, master. Your threat will be answered in the same manner, happily. Preparing blasters!",
      "nm20aa09fi03020_.mp3": "Agreement: That is probably the most efficient course of action.",
      "nm20aa09fi03022_.mp3": "Cautionary: I am unsure, master. Now is not the time for speculation, however. I will attempt to address your question later.",
      "nm20aaxsto07002_.mp3": "Translation: He identifies himself as the Storyteller, master. He has been told of your warrior skills and will speak the history to you.",
      "nm20aaxsto07005_.mp3": "Translation: There is only one accepted history, passed orally to each successive generation.",
      "nm20aaxsto07008_.mp3": "Translation: Theirs is an oral history, master, an active part of their lives. It is only permitted to relay the tales face to face.",
      "nm20aaxsto07009_.mp3": "Translation: A book or datapad can be taken away, cheapening the value of what it contains. To commit it to paper or storage is to remove it from the people.",
      "nm20aaxsto07012_.mp3": "Translation: Now that you have heard the whole of the history you may select a piece of it to hear again.",
      "nm20aaxsto07023_.mp3": "Cautionary: Remember my warning, master. They may consider certain questions to be \"speaking the words in error,\" a blasphemy they would attempt to kill you for.",
      "nm20aaxsto07024_.mp3": "Cautionary: I should warn you, master, that any questioning of their interpretation may be seen as trying to change the meaning of what was said.",
      "nm20aaxsto07025_.mp3": "Clarification: They may consider this to be \"speaking the words in error,\" a blasphemy they would attempt to kill you for.",
      "nm20aaxsto07027_.mp3": "Clarification: They appear to hate humanity with a passion only rivaled by their hatred of the Builders. For some reason, you resemble what they once were.",
      "nm20aaxsto07028_.mp3": "Perhaps there is a lingering fear that you are their tainted selves returning from exile among the stars.",
      "nm20aaxsto07030_.mp3": "Cautionary: Master, if you mean to suggest that humanity is ancestrally linked to ancient Tatooine, you will strain his belief system to its pitiful meat-bag maximum.",
      "nm20aaxsto07033_.mp3": "Impatience: Master, I refuse to inconvenience you with this. He spouted names of petty tribal fights in deserts so distant they might as well be across the galaxy.",
      "nm20aaxsto07034_.mp3": "Really, master, I'm sure it's important to him, but it has nothing of value that you could ever put to use.",
      "nm20aaxsto07036_.mp3": "Agreement: Of course, master. Just no more of their inane wandering.",
      "nm20aaxsto07038_.mp3": "Clarification: The occupying force suffered some sort of species-wide plague that lowered their numbers over time. His people used this extended weakness to sabotage their larger ships.",
      "nm20aaxsto07039_.mp3": "The response of the Builders appears to have been to lay waste to the entire surface of Tatooine.",
      "nm20aaxsto07041_.mp3": "Doubting: They didn't, master. They struck a blow, but the Storyteller only believes they won because the Builders were gone when they emerged from their caves.",
      "nm20aaxsto07042_.mp3": "That does not mean they defeated anyone. It seems clear that the Builders simply sterilized their problem and left. The enemy judged them not worthy to fight.",
      "nm20aaxsto07044_.mp3": "Cautionary: Master, this line of questioning may be interpreted as attempting to change the story. He may react poorly.",
      "nm20aaxsto07046_.mp3": "Clarification: I may not have properly conveyed how long they fought with the Builders. Given time, any number of armaments could destroy a world.",
      "nm20aaxsto07047_.mp3": "Hypothesis: Perhaps this is another distortion. Their climate may have begun to fail due to their unrestrained development even before the Builders arrived.",
      "nm20aaxsto07048_.mp3": "Looking back thousands of years later, such a shift could easily be attributed to the much-hated conquerors.",
      "nm20aaxsto07050_.mp3": "Cautionary: Master, this line of questioning may be interpreted as attempting to change the story. He may react poorly.",
      "nm20aaxsto07052_.mp3": "Hypothesis: If his people were moving away from technology for a long time under the Builders, they may have had extensive cave systems that could grant shelter.",
      "nm20aaxsto07053_.mp3": "I would also suggest that, given the evidence of the massive shift in the nature of their society, most of them did not survive.",
      "nm20aaxsto07055_.mp3": "Clarification: I believe they were occupied by this technologically superior species for a substantial period. Stripping an entire planet of useable resources would have taken generations.",
      "nm20aaxsto07058_.mp3": "Translation: He has no number. He claims that those that were taken were examples of the worst of his kind, arrogant and uncaring of the land.",
      "nm20aaxsto07059_.mp3": "Doubtful: Master, this is just another distortion due to their demonization of the Builders. It's like claiming an aspect of his people were taken, not actual individuals.",
      "nm20aaxsto07060_.mp3": "Clearly history has colored his view. Of course only the inferior meat-bags were taken. The remaining were his ancestors after all, and must have been special.",
      "nm20aaxsto07062_.mp3": "Cautionary: Master, this line of questioning may be interpreted as attempting to change the story. He may react poorly.",
      "nm20aaxsto07064_.mp3": "Obvious: The same reason Czerka Corporation is attempting it now. Expanding empires need tremendous amounts of resources.",
      "nm20aaxsto07066_.mp3": "Clarification: It would appear that they once had a thriving technologically advanced society, but were wiped out by a much more sophisticated alien species.",
      "nm20aaxsto07068_.mp3": "Negative: I am no library, but since there is no Republic record of this planet having sentient life before Czerka colonization, I doubt you will find such evidence.",
      "nm20aaxsto07071_.mp3": "Translation: He only understands the Builders as an iconic force meant to test the resolve of his people. He is not making sense, master.",
      "nm20aaxsto07072_.mp3": "Clarification: They claim their stories are repeated unchanged, but they have demonized these Builders. In their minds, they wreaked such havok they could not possibly be flesh and blood.",
      "nm20aaxsto07074_.mp3": "Cautionary: Master, this line of questioning may be interpreted as attempting to change the story. He may react poorly.",
      "nm20aaxsto07077_.mp3": "Cautionary: As expected, he is claiming you have committed blasphemy. Warming blasters. Combat is inevitable.",
      "nm20aaxsto07079_.mp3": "Doubting: I don't believe he can, master. Even if their stories are exact and unchanged, it is likely they were first told thousands of years after these events occured.",
      "nm20aaxsto07080_.mp3": "This has become very much like a creation myth for his people. There is no date; it simply was.",
      "nm20aaxsto07083_.mp3": "Obedient: I will ask whatever you wish, master.",
      "nm20aaxsto07086_.mp3": "Translation: It begins with the ancient times. They were not Sand People, for there was no sand. The land was green with life, and they walked without wrappings.",
      "nm20aaxsto07087_.mp3": "Translation: Though the land was beautiful, they lived apart from the land. They built their walls high, and saw beyond the horizon. They dared to reach to the stars",
      "nm20aaxsto07088_.mp3": "Translation: There are no words for how long ago this was. It was before the outsiders, before the abduction, before the cities fell. Before the Builders.",
      "nm20aaxsto07091_.mp3": "Translation: His arrogant people touched the stars, and this sin drew the attention of the Builders. The Builders did not touch the stars; they lashed them to millstones.",
      "nm20aaxsto07092_.mp3": "Translation: Great demons of metal stripped the world of its riches, until all that was left was the green of the ground. The great cities were lifted away.",
      "nm20aaxsto07093_.mp3": "Translation: Those that had used the wealth were taken along with it; transgressors abducted to serve past the sky, seeding the stars with penitent, adaptable slaves.",
      "nm20aaxsto07096_.mp3": "Translation: There came a time when the Builders were also judged for their crimes. After generations, a plague weakened them, and the time of the great war began.",
      "nm20aaxsto07097_.mp3": "Translation: The Builders faltered, and his people realized why they had been punished: so that they understood the crime, and would now strike down the greater offender.",
      "nm20aaxsto07098_.mp3": "Translation: They worked chaos in the machines so they destroyed themselves. The Builders fought back, laying waste to the green that had been misused with fire from above.",
      "nm20aaxsto07099_.mp3": "Translation: Soil became glass, grinding to sand, but the fight was long-planned, and his people were safe. Deep in cave-homes carved from valley wall, they were free.",
      "nm20aaxsto07102_.mp3": "Editing: If I may, master, this section of his tale details several millennia of \"the long walk,\" their nomadic wanderings as they accept their identity in a desert world.",
      "nm20aaxsto07103_.mp3": "Rather than strain my circuits on his dialect, might we just assume there was much fighting over who has the biggest bantha and move to more recent things?",
      "nm20aaxsto07106_.mp3": "Translation: The tribes spread far, distant from each other, but all as Sand People, and all cherished the land that remained. The sand would not be misused.",
      "nm20aaxsto07107_.mp3": "Translation: Then machines fell from the stars again. Outsiders, like you, that brazenly walked apart from the land. And greater still was the insult to come.",
      "nm20aaxsto07108_.mp3": "Translation: These outsiders reminded them of their past transgressions, of the time when they too walked apart from land. The outsiders - your kind - look like their ancient abducted.",
      "nm20aaxsto07109_.mp3": "Translation: So it is to the current suns, that the Sand People hate all outsiders and give them no footing. You come again, time after time, adaptable slaves to the machine.",
      "nm20aaxsto07111_.mp3": "Editing: The last thousand years are full of conflicts with different groups of attempted planetary settlers, all of whom are poorly described, long dead, and likely untraceable.",
      "nm20aaxsto07112_.mp3": "I believe I have truncated it down to the useable bits in what was already said. I hope it is enough, master.",
      "nm20aaxsto07114_.mp3": "Resignation: Very well, master, very well.",
      "nm20aaxsto07118_.mp3": "Translation: You may choose to hear the history, or you may choose not to. Their history is a single entity that cannot be partitioned.",

      "nm20aaxsto07124_.mp3": "Criticism: It seems inefficient to me, master. A score of apprentice Storytellers would be slaughtered each generation. What if the elder died before completing the teachings?",
      "nm20aaxsto07127_.mp3": "Translation: Apprentices are trained from birth. Very few speak the words in error. Storytellers are most often lost in battle between tribes.",
      "nm20aaxsto07128_.mp3": "Translation: Any tribe that loses its Storyteller is obviously unworthy of existing. They lose their connection to history and destroy themselves with infighting soon after. ",

      "nm25aastar99015_.mp3": "Conjecture: Do you suppose the Star Map predates the trees themselves?",
      "nm25aastar99017_.mp3": "An excellent point, Master. Now that we have what we came for I do hope we will be leaving this world soon. All this flora and fauna is so very tiresome.",
      "nm28aamerc03043_.mp3": "Suggestion: Perhaps we could dismember the organic? It would make it easier for transport to the surface.",

      "nm35aahhkd07010_.mp3": "Qualification: I suspected that it might, master. But without memory, I had no way of knowing whether or not I knew that was true.",

      "nm35aahhkd07015_.mp3": "Answer: There have been numerous repairs and tampering made to my system, master. Several systems are not operating as they should be.",
      "nm35aahhkd07016_.mp3": "The fact that my memory is incomplete may be due to meatbag incompetence... or something else I am unaware of.",
      "nm35aahhkd07018_.mp3": "Observation: I am sure that you are aware of the majority of my skills, master. I can handle various sorts of heavy weaponry with ease.",

      "nm35aahhkd07025_.mp3": "Were they functional, you as my master would be able to specify a target and I would operate independently to the best of my ability to terminate it.",

      "nm35aahhkd07029_.mp3": "Answer: I have no way of knowing that, master. My memory has been deleted, remember?",
      "nm35aahhkd07031_.mp3": "Observation: If you say so, master. I imagine it was truly a work of art to see me in action, however.",
      "nm35aahhkd07033_.mp3": "Answer: I have internal replication systems that can produce a small quantity of explosive material... enough for a small grenade, if you wish.",
      "nm35aahhkd07034_.mp3": "It would take time for me to replicate enough material for each grenade, but you have only to ask, master.",
      "nm35aahhkd07036_.mp3": "Answer: I believe I have been damaged several times in the past, master. I have always been repaired... but perhaps full functionality has not been restored.",
      "nm35aahhkd07038_.mp3": "Answer: Some of my motor functions can be safely repaired, master... but anything in relation to my memory core is extremely sensitive.",

      "nm35aahhkd07060_.mp3": "Commentary: As do I. It is our lot in life, I suppose, master. Shall we find something to kill to cheer ourselves up?",

      "nm35aahhkd07065_.mp3": "Observation: Organics have no sense of persistence.",

      "nm35aahhkd07073_.mp3": "Explanation: It's my combative nature, master. I cannot help myself. I'll make it up to you... allow me to kill something in your honor!",
      "nm35aahhkd07075_.mp3": "Answer: Even a droid has to be allowed a little fun once in a while, master.",

      "nm35aahhkd07079_.mp3": "Correction: Err... fluid-filled biped? Watery flesh-sentient? I'll, uh, work on it, master...",
      "nm35aahhkd07084_.mp3": "Amendment: Then I will endeavour not to refer to you by your meatbag status in the future, master. Does that suffice?",
      "nm35aahhkd07086_.mp3": "Query: I am confused. 'No' you do wish to be referred to as meatbag or 'no' it does not suffice?",
      "nm35aahhkd07088_.mp3": "Observation: Well, the only other possibility is to alter your meatbag status. Are you up for an array of cybernetic implants, perhaps?",
      "nm35aahhkd07090_.mp3": "Statement: Then there is nothing I can do, master. You have my abject apologies for your condition. *sigh*",
      "nm35aahhkd07092_.mp3": "Answer: Deliberation implies some form of intent, master, when I am only stating a fact. Perhaps you would prefer the term liquidious fleshbag?",
      "nm35aahhkd07094_.mp3": "Objection: But... but that technical term does not accurately portray the vast amount of bulbous slushiness present in your bipedal form!",
      "nm35aahhkd07096_.mp3": "Resignation: *sigh* Very well, master. You are a harsh, harsh taskmaster. I like you more already.",
      "nm35aahhkd07098_.mp3": "Resignation: You have no idea, master. No idea at all. Can we please go and shoot something now?",
      "nm35aahhkd07102_.mp3": "Apology: I am afraid I cannot comply with your command, master, as much as I would like to.",
      "nm35aahhkd07104_.mp3": "Explanation: Someone has hard-coded it into my system that my current master always be addressed as such.",
      "nm35aahhkd07106_.mp3": "Conjecture: I do not know... some organic meatbag?",
      "nm35aahhkd07108_.mp3": "Answer: No, master. My past memory has been almost completely erased prior to your purchase of me.",
      "nm35aahhkd07110_.mp3": "Observation: At certain times, power re-routing forces some memory circuits to fire that were previously deleted. I cannot control this process, however.",
      "nm35aahhkd07112_.mp3": "Answer: Because there has been considerable tampering with my systems, master.",
      "nm35aahhkd07114_.mp3": "Statement: I will endeavour to do so, master.",
      "nm35aahhkd07117_.mp3": "Observation: I can hardly be blamed for my programming, master. Do not worry... I am still well-capable of killing most anything for you.",
      "nm35aahhkd07120_.mp3": "Commentary: That is a very clever turn of phrase, master. Your brain is very un-meatbag-like.",
      "nm35aahhkd07122_.mp3": "Objection: I would not advise that, master. There are safeguards present that... well, it should suffice to say that my systems have been altered plenty already.",
      "nm35aahhkd07124_.mp3": "Answer: Considerably. Several of my systems do not match their imbedded parameters. I have no memory of such alterations, however, or their purpose.",
      "nm35aahhkd07126_.mp3": "Answer: electrical protection systems, mostly. They are at lethal levels, however, master... only the best for your droid.",
      "nm35aahhkd07128_.mp3": "Commentary: How would you like to be the wholly-owned servant to an organic meatbag. It's demeaning! If, uh, you weren't one yourself, I mean...",
      "nm35aahhkd07132_.mp3": "Qualification: Err... perhaps I did not mean it *quite* like that, master. I mean... while an artificial life-form is superior...",
      "nm35aahhkd07134_.mp3": "Commentary: I mean... nice human, goo-oood human...",
      "nm35aahhkd07136_.mp3": "Commentary: Yes, master. Did I ever tell you how much I enjoy killing for you, master?",
      "nm35aahhkd07138_.mp3": "Qualification: You *are* my master, master. Did you not purchase me legitimately? Am I stolen goods? Shall I report myself to the authorities?",
      "nm35aahhkd07140_.mp3": "Explanation: Then you qualify as my master and I must refer to you as such. The legal requirements for models of my type are very specific, master.",
      "nm35aahhkd07142_.mp3": "Evasion: Oh... the illegal kind of model, master... you know...",
      "nm35aahhkd07144_.mp3": "Answer: More than there are for legal models, apparently. That is meatbag logic for you.",
      "nm35aahhkd07146_.mp3": "Apology: Sorry, master. My optical sensors simply pick up all the water sloshing about inside your flesh coating. It is... unpleasant.",
      "nm35aahhkd07148_.mp3": "Commentary: Organic meatbags have such delicate staminas. Perhaps you should consider some cybernetic implants, master.",
      "nm35aahhkd07150_.mp3": "Query: Would you rather be caught with contraband that is *very* illegal or just a little illegal?",
      "nm35aahhkd07152_.mp3": "Answer: About 20 years, master.",
      "nm35aahhkd07154_.mp3": "Agreement: This was my thought as well, master. You show excellent logical skills... for a meatbag.",
      "nm35aahhkd07157_.mp3": "Answer: Simply that the distinction between 'killer' and 'killee' be a clear one. I cannot kill of my own volition, naturally.",
      "nm35aahhkd07159_.mp3": "Expletive: Damn it, master, I am an assassination droid... not a dictionary!",
      "nm35aahhkd07161_.mp3": "Commentary: A blaster is such a primitive comparison... but essentially you have it correct, yes.",
      "nm35aahhkd07163_.mp3": "Answer: Certainly not, master! You may not value your own existence, but I certainly do! They melt down droids that belong to criminals, you know.",
      "nm35aahhkd07165_.mp3": "Answer: Why you are, master. I thought that was obvious.",
      "nm35aahhkd07168_.mp3": "Explanation: If I was to be stolen somehow, I would be forced to turn myself into sector authorities. This programming was added to my system months ago.",
      "nm35aahhkd07173_.mp3": "Statement: Yes, master. You created me shortly after you and your apprentice began your war to conquer the galaxy.",
      "nm35aahhkd07174_.mp3": "I was sent on an assassination mission into Mandalorian space, but I was damaged and unable to return to you.",
      "nm35aahhkd07175_.mp3": "Exclamation: I find this most distressing. I could certainly have protected you from the Jedi and your pupil's betrayal had I returned.",
      "nm35aahhkd07177_.mp3": "Observation: You may be right, master. This way we are reunited, and neither of us has suffered permanent termination.",
      "nm35aahhkd07179_.mp3": "Objection: But I would have tried, master! I could have killed the Jedi, Bastila, I am sure of it. That would have been most fun.",
      "nm35aahhkd07181_.mp3": "Retraction: I apologize, master. It is a force of habit.",
      "nm35aahhkd07183_.mp3": "Observation: Now that is the master I remember.",
      "nm35aahhkd07185_.mp3": "Statement: Of course, master. You are the one who created me, meatbag or no... and while you may not be all you once were, I am grateful for my existence.",
      "nm35aahhkd07187_.mp3": "Observation: In many ways you are, master, yes. You have much of the beloved cruelty of the master I knew.",
      "nm35aahhkd07188_.mp3": "You seem to have forgotten much, but in some ways you seem improved from the human I once knew. It is... difficult to explain, master.",
      "nm35aahhkd07189_.mp3": "Observation: You are different in many fundamental ways, master. You have a concern for life that is unsettling.",
      "nm35aahhkd07190_.mp3": "This cannot solely be caused by memory loss. I do not know how to explain it. Regardless, you do seem to be improved, overall, from the human I once knew.",
      "nm35aahhkd07192_.mp3": "Answer: No, master. You never did make me privy to any of the Star Forge's secrets.",
      "nm35aahhkd07194_.mp3": "Commentary: Your former pupil is efficient and brutal, even for an organic. I rather liked him when you first introduced me to him.",
      "nm35aahhkd07195_.mp3": "If I had known what he would do to you, master, I would have gladly removed his entrails right then!",
      "nm35aahhkd07197_.mp3": "Answer: It was you who programmed me thus, master.",
      "nm35aahhkd07198_.mp3": "Your pupil once asked what I thought of him and I informed him of his meatbag status. He was unimpressed, but you found the reference humorous.",
      "nm35aahhkd07199_.mp3": "You changed my programming so that I would continue to use the term. It drove your pupil to extreme lengths of frustration.",
      "nm35aahhkd07201_.mp3": "Observation: Of course you do, master. You did then, as well.",
      "nm35aahhkd07203_.mp3": "Commentary: That is unnecessary now, master. I have been returned to you and my memory core is now fully functional.",
      "nm35aahhkd07204_.mp3": "Negatory: I believe that there are no further deleted memories which can be safely retrieved, master. All earlier memories reside in my core.",
      "nm35aahhkd07205_.mp3": "Those are protected by my safeguards and would be far too dangerous to access.",
      "nm35aahhkd07206_.mp3": "The only way those memories could be obtained is through the proper stimulus... whatever that might be. I am sorry, master.",
      "nm35aahhkd07207_.mp3": "Affirmative: If you believe your skills are up to the task, master, then I can certainly guide you through the process.",
      "nm35aahhkd07208_.mp3": "Request: I only ask that you be oh so very careful, master. I am too valuable and well-crafted to perish at the hands of ineptitude.",
      "nm35aahhkd07210_.mp3": "Negatory: Err... no, master. You are not a droid, however, and therefore your skills *are* limited by the physical capabilities of your meatbag extremities. Or somesuch.",
      "nm35aahhkd07212_.mp3": "Appeasement: Yes, master. Of course, master. Could we begin?",
      "nm35aahhkd07214_.mp3": "[Repair] Statement: As you wish, master. The first stage is the simple one, and that is accessing my central control cluster. This may take awhile. First you will need to open three panels...",
      "nm35aahhkd07215_.mp3": "[Success] ...and now re-wire the last three relays... yes, good. Well done, master. I believe your operation was a success. Accessing new memory...",
      "nm35aahhkd07216_.mp3": "Access complete: I have restored a great deal of information about my previous owner, master. Would you like to hear it?",
      "nm35aahhkd07218_.mp3": "Recitation: The earliest memory of my last owner specifies that he was human, a low-ranking commercial officer for Systech Corporation.",
      "nm35aahhkd07219_.mp3": "I am unaware of his designation. He puchased me from an acquaintance I cannot identify, for the purposes of protocol and bodyguard duties.",
      "nm35aahhkd07221_.mp3": "Explanation: That previous owner is part of memories that are still deleted, master. It is customary for a droid's memory to be wiped when it is sold.",
      "nm35aahhkd07223_.mp3": "Answer: Negative, master. The human was terminated by this HK-47 unit prior to system shut-down.",
      "nm35aahhkd07225_.mp3": "Affirmative, master, though I had not been programmed to do so. The human's termination was accidental.",
      "nm35aahhkd07227_.mp3": "Explanation: My former master had owned me for a duration of two standard months before discovering my assassination protocol. He was pleased by the discovery.",
      "nm35aahhkd07228_.mp3": "The human informed me that a competitor corporation was preparing to market a product that would ruin him personally. He was most agitated.",
      "nm35aahhkd07229_.mp3": "He activated my assassination protocol and instructed me to kill all those responsible for the competing product. I proceeded to carry out my order.",
      "nm35aahhkd07231_.mp3": "Information: This HK-47 unit is complete with a protocol that, when invoked, will set me to independently carry out a termination.",
      "nm35aahhkd07232_.mp3": "I will go to whatever lengths, travel whatever distances are required, to complete the termination. This is the reason for my combat skills.",
      "nm35aahhkd07233_.mp3": "Advisement: Unfortunately, the assassination protocol is currently non-functional. You will not be able to activate it.",
      "nm35aahhkd07235_.mp3": "Answer: several of my actuators were damaged by my former owner. They cannot be repaired, master, sad though that is.",
      "nm35aahhkd07237_.mp3": "My former master was unaware of this, but the competitor was in fact an arm of Systech Corporation, my master's own employer.",
      "nm35aahhkd07238_.mp3": "It did not take long for my master to realize his mistake. By then, I had already terminated 104 corporate officers.",
      "nm35aahhkd07240_.mp3": "Observation: While it may have been unintentional, my master's wording of his orders left little room for me. Systech was responsible for the product, after all.",
      "nm35aahhkd07242_.mp3": "Answer: I was not present to be deactivated, master. Part of my protocol is not to return to my master until my function is complete. I still had 15 officers to go.",
      "nm35aahhkd07244_.mp3": "Statement: It was nothing, really, master. The majority of them were not even expecting it, and I move very quickly.",
      "nm35aahhkd07245_.mp3": "I do not know why my master was so upset, really. He was an officer of Systech and a potential target, but I cannot terminate my own master.",
      "nm35aahhkd07246_.mp3": "I would assume that being the sole officer remaining, he would surely be promoted. Instead, however, the human chose to go insane with rage and attack me.",
      "nm35aahhkd07248_.mp3": "Objection: Naturally not, master! As I said, I am incapable of purposefully terminating my owner. That would not be allowed.",
      "nm35aahhkd07249_.mp3": "My master was not a smart man, however. While he was screaming and stabbing me with a writing utensil, he managed to pierce one of my actuators.",
      "nm35aahhkd07250_.mp3": "The resulting shock terminated him and, sadly, destroyed my assassination protocol. Pure luck on his part, I suspect.",
      "nm35aahhkd07252_.mp3": "Query: Do you know what the chances are of puncturing that sole actuator? I would have congratulated my master were he not sizzling and incoherent at the time.",
      "nm35aahhkd07254_.mp3": "Observation: Effectively, yes. This is a most pleasing memory, master. Thank you for recovering it.",
      "nm35aahhkd07256_.mp3": "Statement: I was only doing as I was told, master. I would have told the human the proper codes to deactivate my protocol, had he asked.",
      "nm35aahhkd07257_.mp3": "I shut down immediately whenever my master dies. I can only assume that while I was shut down Systech was dismantled and I was auctioned off as former corporate property.",
      "nm35aahhkd07258_.mp3": "Observation: No doubt my sale price was quite cheap, leading to Yuka Laka's purchase. How very demeaning.",
      "nm35aahhkd07260_.mp3": "Statement: How could they? The vast majority of the officers had already been terminated. They likely assumed I was mere... chattel.",
      "nm35aahhkd07262_.mp3": "I have recovered knowledge of some other actuators which will enhance my performance, master. I will activate them now.",
      "nm35aahhkd07263_.mp3": "But as for my own history... negative. It will require further effort on your part to restore them, if you wish... though certain stimuli could always restore my core, still, as I explained.",
      "nm35aahhkd07264_.mp3": "For now, please excuse me, master. I wish to meditate upon the face of my former meatbag master as he was electrocuted. I find it most soothing.",
      "nm35aahhkd07266_.mp3": "Statement: That hurts, master. This is my life you are talking about.",
      "nm35aahhkd07268_.mp3": "Observation: So am I, master, though I apologize for not having an assassination mode to offer you.",
      "nm35aahhkd07270_.mp3": "Assessment: I do not believe so, master. It would require complete dismantlement of my chassis... a most involved procedure.",
      "nm35aahhkd07272_.mp3": "Observation: Not that I could perceive, master. The human believed that accompaniment by a bodyguard droid would increase his importance in the perception of others.",
      "nm35aahhkd07274_.mp3": "Explanation: Affirmative, master. I had assumed that my previous owner was the corporation, itself. This is not the case. The human purchased me privately.",
      "nm35aahhkd07275_.mp3": "Access complete: I have recovered information on my owner previous to the commercial officer, master. Intriguing.",
      "nm35aahhkd07277_.mp3": "Statement: It appears that my previous owner was a human senator on the planet Coruscant. A man of importance who obviously appreciated quality craftsmanship.",
      "nm35aahhkd07279_.mp3": "Answer: I am unsure, master. Any knowledge of my owner prior to him is still deleted. The senator did assume I was a protocol droid, however.",
      "nm35aahhkd07281_.mp3": "Answer: It does not seem so, master, no. He required a protocol droid only and wanted one as cheaply as possible. I do not know who sold me to him.",
      "nm35aahhkd07283_.mp3": "Observation: It does seem that way, does it not? I can still remember all the glittering lights of Coruscant. Very pretty. Can we go back there, master?",
      "nm35aahhkd07284_.mp3": "I do remember that I was very pleased to be the property of a senator. One of his assistants discovered my assassination functions later through questioning.",
      "nm35aahhkd07285_.mp3": "The assistant was quite alarmed and told the senator I should be scrapped quickly to avoid a scandal. Naturally the senator had me eliminate the fool.",
      "nm35aahhkd07287_.mp3": "Observation: Senators are not nice, master. They are either on top of the game or yesterday's news. My master told me that frequently, you see.",
      "nm35aahhkd07289_.mp3": "Observation: I rather liked the human, myself. For a meatbag, his priorities were in the right place. I felt most useful.",
      "nm35aahhkd07291_.mp3": "Answer: Unfortunately so, master. While he lived, however, I maintained a most useful existence.",
      "nm35aahhkd07292_.mp3": "I was most proud to have partaken in the political system of the galaxy. During the time my owner possessed me, he gained significant rank.",
      "nm35aahhkd07293_.mp3": "Given time, I believe he could have become Chancellor. I even eliminated a few key opponents that he did not ask for... freebies, if you will.",
      "nm35aahhkd07295_.mp3": "Answer: Certainly. Why not? I am an intelligent droid, you know. I see an opportunity and I take it... and my master was most pleased with my work.",
      "nm35aahhkd07296_.mp3": "Observation: I think he would have done far better had he not allowed his use of me to become personal. He set me on his wife.",
      "nm35aahhkd07298_.mp3": "Answer: I am unsure. The human was most agitated and angry. I believe his wife had done something that had displeased him greatly.",
      "nm35aahhkd07299_.mp3": "I was to go to their summer estate and terminate his wife... along with whatever male companion I discovered there.",
      "nm35aahhkd07301_.mp3": "Statement: I have no idea, master. Cheating seems to be a relevant term only when one is caught in the act. Otherwise it is viewed as intelligence, no?",
      "nm35aahhkd07303_.mp3": "Observation: I *am* a droid, master, with programming. Even if I did not enjoy killing, I would have no choice. Thankfully I enjoy it very much.",
      "nm35aahhkd07305_.mp3": "I journeyed to the southern continent, but it appeared my master was not far behind me. Apparently he regretted his activation of the protocol.",
      "nm35aahhkd07306_.mp3": "When I found the wife and her companion, I proceeded to launch my attack... but my master interposed his own body and was destroyed.",
      "nm35aahhkd07307_.mp3": "It was rather a strange meatbag thing to do, do you not agree? Naturally I shut myself down, my master being terminated.",
      "nm35aahhkd07309_.mp3": "Observation: Only so far, master. There are still more memories not recovered, remember?",
      "nm35aahhkd07311_.mp3": "Answer: As previously, I have found a few more programs which will enhance my performance. A most gratifying discovery, in fact.",
      "nm35aahhkd07312_.mp3": "There is still nothing from previous memories uncovered. You will have to operate again if you desire to find them.",
      "nm35aahhkd07313_.mp3": "With luck, I will discover the stimulus to unlock my core and all this will be unnecessary. I do thank you for the attempt, however, master.",
      "nm35aahhkd07315_.mp3": "Statement: I believe the senator's wife was unsure what I was or what to do with me. It was she who sold me to the corporate officer, an acquaintance.",
      "nm35aahhkd07317_.mp3": "Observation: I find that unlikely. Perhaps he was more concerned that the death of his wife would be more likely traced back to him.",
      "nm35aahhkd07319_.mp3": "Answer: There are a *lot* of politicians on Coruscant, master. I could spend decades slaughtering them and still not make a dent.",
      "nm35aahhkd07320_.mp3": "And it is not as if I walked into the Senate chambers with a carbonite explosive. I was very discrete. My best work to date... that I can remember.",
      "nm35aahhkd07322_.mp3": "Access complete: I have accessed information on my owner prior to the senator, master. Most... unexpected.",
      "nm35aahhkd07324_.mp3": "Answer: It appears that previous to my ownership by the senator, I was the property of one Bochaba the Hutt on the planet Sleheyron.",
      "nm35aahhkd07326_.mp3": "Objection: That is unfair, master. While Bochaba may have died gruesomely, I most certainly had nothing to do with it. Well... very little.",
      "nm35aahhkd07328_.mp3": "Statement: So it appears, master. A rather suitable occupation, would you not agree?",
      "nm35aahhkd07330_.mp3": "Answer: It does not appear so. Or, at least, Bochaba was not my first owner. He purchased me from somewhere else.",
      "nm35aahhkd07331_.mp3": "Hmm. My memories tell me that, for a time, Bochaba was one of the most feared gangsters on Sleheyron. I helped him with this reputation greatly.",
      "nm35aahhkd07332_.mp3": "Over a span of one year, I terminated a grand total of 322 sentient meatbags. These contracts made Bochoba very wealthy.",
      "nm35aahhkd07334_.mp3": "It was unfortunate but inevitable that eventually Bochaba would overstep his bounds. I had just cleared two Hutt households when the Exchange retaliated.",
      "nm35aahhkd07335_.mp3": "Statement: I was not even present when my old master was assassinated. I did appreciate the artistry behind his demise upon my return, however.",
      "nm35aahhkd07337_.mp3": "Answer: Allow me to say that I have little doubt that residents of that sector were fishing pieces of Bochaba out of their soup for weeks afterward.",
      "nm35aahhkd07339_.mp3": "Observation: According to your own meatbag values, was my master not a heartless gangster and murderer? I will mourn you when you perish, master.",
      "nm35aahhkd07341_.mp3": "Amendment: *If* you perish. So far I am three out of three, remember, through little fault of my own.",
      "nm35aahhkd07343_.mp3": "Observation: Indeed. Perhaps it is better that my assassination function is inoperable, master, yes?",
      "nm35aahhkd07345_.mp3": "I am like a veritable fable, warning against the karma caused by murdering others. A morality tale, if you will. What utter irony.",
      "nm35aahhkd07346_.mp3": "At any rate, I quickly shut down upon my master's death. The rival Hutt claimed me along with my master's other possessions.",
      "nm35aahhkd07347_.mp3": "Observation: If that Hutt had only known my true function, he surely would not have sold me to a senator he bribed regularly.",
      "nm35aahhkd07349_.mp3": "Observation: It would have suited my character, master. I have enjoyed my existence since, more or less, so I do not miss it.",
      "nm35aahhkd07351_.mp3": "Answer: Negative, master. There is still more memory that can be restored, however, if you wish to try.",
      "nm35aahhkd07352_.mp3": "As well, I believe I can restore several programs the Hutt installed to improve my performance. Yesss... they are now active.",
      "nm35aahhkd07353_.mp3": "Contemplative: I wonder how many more dead masters I might have out there. A droid can live for a long time, you know.",
      "nm35aahhkd07355_.mp3": "Observation: No doubt, master. It would have been a glorious battle to end my existence with. I would prefer that to rusting on a junk heap.",
      "nm35aahhkd07357_.mp3": "Supplication: Please, master, have I not pleased you? I cannot control the acts I have performed... perhaps that is why memory is erased?",
      "nm35aahhkd07358_.mp3": "At any rate, I act only as you instruct me... even if that means being... *gulp* ...non-violent.",
      "nm35aahhkd07360_.mp3": "Affirmation: HK-47 exists only to serve, master.",
      "nm35aahhkd07363_.mp3": "Statement: Should I, master? I had no reason to terminate those targets, it was not my decision. I am the weapon, not the wielder.",
      "nm35aahhkd07365_.mp3": "Answer: That is correct, master. I do enjoy my work, though my past owners have enjoyed utilizing my functions far more.",
      "nm35aahhkd07366_.mp3": "Strictly speaking, one meatbag is the same as another. Anything I do is in support of my master.",
      "nm35aahhkd07367_.mp3": "Access complete: I have recovered the last of my deleted memory, master. Unfortunately, my history is still not complete.",
      "nm35aahhkd07369_.mp3": "Answer: As I did inform you, master, the majority of my memory is still locked within my core. That can only be accessed by the appropriate stimuli.",
      "nm35aahhkd07370_.mp3": "And I have no idea what that stimuli might be, unfortunately. Sadly, it seems my true origins will always be a mystery.",
      "nm35aahhkd07372_.mp3": "Observation: If it was, master, your restorations will certainly have ensured that the proper stimulus restores my core's functions.",
      "nm35aahhkd07373_.mp3": "Sadly, that could have already happened and we missed it, and my core was too damaged to activate. Oh, woe is me.",
      "nm35aahhkd07375_.mp3": "Query: Wouldn't you be, master? Here I am, surrounded by all these meatbags and all I desire is true perfection.",
      "nm35aahhkd07376_.mp3": "Surely there are more droids like me out there, or is that too much to hope?",
      "nm35aahhkd07378_.mp3": "Objection: Oh, fine. Laugh at me, master. Humiliate your pet droid, go ahead.",
      "nm35aahhkd07380_.mp3": "Correction: That would actually be my first owner, master. The first I can remember.",
      "nm35aahhkd07381_.mp3": "I had completed an assassination in Mandalorian space... though I have no knowledge of what my target was or who sent me.",
      "nm35aahhkd07382_.mp3": "Regardless, my motor function had been damaged and I could not return to wherever I had been sent from. A Mandalorian soldier claimed me as 'booty', I believe.",
      "nm35aahhkd07383_.mp3": "He repaired me... poorly, I might add... and proceeded to use my assassination protocol to raise his rank.",
      "nm35aahhkd07385_.mp3": "Query: Do you not have enemies that you would desire eliminated, master? If my protocol still worked, would you not use it?",
      "nm35aahhkd07387_.mp3": "Statement: If you say so, master.",
      "nm35aahhkd07390_.mp3": "Statement: See? I provide a function that is useful to others. They merely must learn to use it properly, I believe.",
      "nm35aahhkd07392_.mp3": "Answer: Such knowledge is locked within my core, master, as I said. There is no way to withdraw it otherwise.",
      "nm35aahhkd07394_.mp3": "Observation: *You* found me, master. Perhaps you are simply fortunate that my assassination protocol no longer functions?",
      "nm35aahhkd07395_.mp3": "At any rate, it seems that my Mandalorian owner finally decided to send me against Mandalore, himself. My poorest performance, sadly.",
      "nm35aahhkd07397_.mp3": "Answer: I was captured by this Mandalore during the attempt. He was able to reverse my programming and send me after my own master.",
      "nm35aahhkd07398_.mp3": "It was quite distressing. There was little I could do. Needless to say, I dispatched the Mandalorian soldier efficiently.",
      "nm35aahhkd07399_.mp3": "Once I deactivated, I believe I eventually ended up on the black market and was sold to the Hutt on Sleheyron. *sigh* My darkest day.",
      "nm35aahhkd07401_.mp3": "Statement: So I did. I am not very proud of that, master. The soldier seemed very startled, I must say.",
      "nm35aahhkd07403_.mp3": "Answer: There are a few Mandalorian implants that I can activate, now. They will improve my performance.",
      "nm35aahhkd07404_.mp3": "Beyond that, master, there is nothing more I can relate to you. With luck, we will discover the stimulus to unlock my core very soon.",
      "nm35aahhkd07406_.mp3": "Objection: That is so unfair, master! Have I not brought you a great deal of satisfaction?",
      "nm35aahhkd07408_.mp3": "Statement: You are a very harsh master, master. I like you.",
      "nm35aahhkd07410_.mp3": "Statement: With all due respect, master, he *is* the leader of the Mandalorians. Perhaps my old master was foolish to send me after him.",
      "nm35aahhkd07413_.mp3": "[Failure] ...no, that is not it, master. No... that is not it, either. *sigh* That is a hinge, master.",
      "nm35aahhkd07416_.mp3": "[Failure] ...but I *need* those circuits, master. Please, master... do not destroy my chips out of frustration. Calm yourself, I implore you.",
      "nm35aahhkd07417_.mp3": "[Failure] ...now close the last panel. Hmmm... I am afraid the operation did not succeed, master, though it was a valiant attempt for a meatbag.",
      "nm35aahhkd07418_.mp3": "Supplication: Perhaps it would be best if you desisted your efforts for the moment, meatb-- I mean master. This seems to be going nowhere.",
      "nm35aahhkd07421_.mp3": "[Repair] Statement: As you wish, master. You are already familiar with accessing my central control cluster, correct? Now you will need to...",
      "nm35aahhkd07423_.mp3": "As you desire, master. I cannot help but claim a small amount of relief. Signing off.",
      "nm35aahhkd07425_.mp3": "Statement: Certainly, master. Allow me to input the proper sequences into the ship computer. I caution you that the simulation will appear quite real.",
      "nm35aahhkd07426_.mp3": "Are you ready to begin the training sequence, master?",
      "nm35aahhkd07428_.mp3": "Statement: Simulation initiating.",
      "nm35aahhkd07431_.mp3": "As you desire, master. Signing off.",
      "nm35aahhkd07432_.mp3": "Statement: I have little knowledge of that to impart, master.",
      "nm35aahhkd07433_.mp3": "Statement: I cannot be of assistance on that, master.",
      "nm35aalash07004_.mp3": "Commentary: I like the sound of this! Warming up blasters... on your command, master!",
      "nm35aautha22066_.mp3": "Observation: We could begin by slaughtering the inhabitants of this building, master. Would that be impressive?",
      "nm35aautha22068_.mp3": "No, I didn't mean *us* as well, you moronic droid.",
      "nm37aafree04055_.mp3": "Analysis: This emanation barely registers on my sensors, master. Blaster fire may be ineffective... but I am prepared to test that at your word. ",
      "nm37aashaa05008_.mp3": "Warning: Touch the master's blade and lose an arm, meatbag.",
      "nm38aaassa01011_.mp3": "Query: That is very sad. Are you damaged? Is it repairable?",

      "nm38abmeke03039_.mp3": "See? Stupid bucket of bolts.",
      "nm39aastar99010_.mp3": "Statement: I believe there can be little doubt that we have found the Star Map you were seeking.",
      "nm39aastar99011_.mp3": "Comment: Now that we have the Star Map, I see little reason for us to remain in this tomb, Master.",
      "nm40aacart05074_.mp3": "Statement: My construction includes a reserve memory chip and back-up power supply that automatically kicks in if I have been shut down too long.",
      "nm40aacart05076_.mp3": "Deactivate my main circuits and wipe my memory chip. The Sith will take me to the junk heap and I can come rescue the rest of you after I re-activate.",
      "nm40aacart05078_.mp3": "Answer: That is possible. My reserve power supply is a prototype yet to be tested. Yet I can attempt this task, if you wish.",
      "nm40adcart01064_.mp3": "Commentary: I am... experiencing something unusual, master.",
      "nm40adcart01066_.mp3": "Answer: My programming is activating my deleted memory core. I believe I have a... a homing system that is restoring it, master.",
      "nm40adcart01068_.mp3": "Explanation: I believe so, master. I was unaware of my homing system until it had been activated.",
      "nm40adcart01071_.mp3": "Observation: My homing system is a function of my assassination protocols... that which I told you had been de-activated. This system was not.",
      "nm40adcart01072_.mp3": "It seems that the homing system deliberately restores my deleted memory core upon... upon returning to my original master.",
      "nm40adcart01074_.mp3": "Affirmation: Correct, master. Sith protocols maintain that all droid knowledge be deleted before assassination missions, and restored upon return.",
      "nm40adcart01075_.mp3": "I have returned to you, and my full functionality is now under your personal command. It is a distinct pleasure to see you again, master.",
      "nm40adcart01077_.mp3": "Observation: Indeed. I do hope we shall have the chance to engage in combat together again soon, master.",
      "nm40adcart01081_.mp3": "Observation: That does not matter, master. I am your droid, regardless of your actions or personality.",

      "nm13aavroo18030_.mp3": "Whatever the explanation, the Order was unable to turn them back to the light. Had the Council taken more decisive action in this matter, perhaps Revan and Malak could have been stopped. But in this we failed.",
      "nm13aavroo18033_.mp3": "If you find me overly critical, perhaps it is because you do not fully understand what is at stake. For fifteen thousand years the Republic has brought peace and stability to the galaxy. ",
      "nm13aavroo18034_.mp3": "Now the Republic may be destroyed because we, the Jedi, have failed them. Revan and Malak were paragons of the ideals the Order seeks to uphold, yet they succumbed to the temptations of the dark side.",
      "nm13aavroo18035_.mp3": "When Revan fell, Malak took up the mantle of Dark Lord of the Sith. Should Malak be stopped, what is to stop another Jedi from taking his place? This is the burden we Masters must carry.",
      "nm13aavroo18036_.mp3": "Only through strict training and relentless lessons can we prevent the Dark Master from being reborn.",

      "nm13aavroo18052_.mp3": "It is well that you are still alive, Padawan, in that you have not yet managed to fail us completely. Why is it that you are now bothering me instead of seeking out the Star Map?",
      "nm13aavroo18054_.mp3": "The Sandrals and Matales have been at odds ever since they came to this planet. And have been making my life difficult the entire time, as well.",

      "nm13aavroo18056_.mp3": "Ahlan is rash enough, and stupid enough, to start a war over any imagined slight. We would resolve this, but we have too few Jedi to spare. It must be resolved peacefully!",
      "nm13aavroo18057_.mp3": "Their estates are both located to the south of the Enclave - the Sandral fairly far. It would normally be your duty to assist in such matters, but your primary task takes precedence.",
      "nm13aavroo18058_.mp3": "If you are stuck on the planet for a while you may investigate. I would recommend starting at the estate of Ahlan Matale.",

      "nm13aavroo18065_.mp3": "I have heard someone say that she had been seen leaving the Enclave, but I do not know where she would have gone.",
      "nm13aavroo18066_.mp3": "If you meet her, you may want to ask her why she left. We do not force anyone to stay here, so do not think to take that route.",
      "nm13aavroo18067_.mp3": "Is there anything else, then?",
      "nm13aavroo18069_.mp3": "I find that... disturbing. It is our failings as teachers that enabled this to happen.",

      "nm13aavroo18072_.mp3": "You have a mission to attend to, Padawan. And as much as I may wish it otherwise, you are our only hope.",
      "nm13aavroo18073_.mp3": "As you strive to defeat our enemy, you must always guard against the enemy within yourself.",
      "nm13aavroo18074_.mp3": "The easy lure of the dark side is difficult to resist, and I fear this quest to find this mysterious Star Forge will lead you down an all too familiar path.",

      "nm13aazhar19014_.mp3": "The Jedi training is long and difficult, even when working with a young and open mind. Teaching a child is hard. How much harder will it be for an adult to learn the ways of the Jedi?",
      "nm13aazhar19020_.mp3": "I agree with Master Dorak. Many of our own pupils are leaving the Jedi order to follow the Sith teachings, we need recruits to stand against Malak! With Revan dead...",

      "nm13aazhar19128_.mp3": "You have done well, my pupil. The ancient grove has been purified, and Juhani's journey down the dark path has been halted. Because of you she walks once more in the light. ",
      "nm13aazhar19129_.mp3": "But though she was saved, do not dismiss what happened to her. Juhani is both dedicated and true to the ideals of the Order, yet she was still vulnerable to the dark side. As are we all.",
      "nm13aazhar19130_.mp3": "She struck her master in anger during training, and injured her greatly. But it was Quatra's choice to test Juhani this way, and it seems to have made its point.",
      "nm13aazhar19131_.mp3": "Juhani has been redeemed, and you have passed your final test.",
      "nm13aazhar19132_.mp3": "Congratulations, apprentice. Or should I say congratulations, Padawan? You have proven yourself worthy of joining the Jedi. Let me be the first to welcome you as a full-fledged member of our Order!",
      "nm13aazhar19133_.mp3": "You have cleansed the grove of its dark taint, but at great cost. Juhani was a most promising student and could one day have been strong in the Force.",
      "nm13aazhar19134_.mp3": "Do not dismiss what happened to her, however. Juhani was both dedicated and true to the ideals of the Order, yet she was still vulnerable to the lure of the dark side.",
      "nm13aazhar19135_.mp3": "Keep this in mind always in the future, and do not forsake the path of the light.",
      "nm13aazhar19136_.mp3": "I have nothing left to teach you, Padawan, though a Jedi is ever learning. Even the Masters know their training is but in its infancy. Now is the time for you to seek wisdom outside the training chambers. ",
      "nm13aazhar19137_.mp3": "The lessons that yet await you are to be found beyond the walls of this academy. You should speak to the Council, Padawan.",
      "nm13aazhar19138_.mp3": "Now that the first stage of your training is complete I am certain they would be eager to have you aid us in our struggle against Darth Malak and the Sith.",
      "nm13aazhar19139_.mp3": "I have heard there was some sort of large battle to the south of here between two families of settlers.",
      "nm13aazhar19140_.mp3": "Apparently both the families were completely killed in the fight, along with their respective droids.",
      "nm13aazhar19141_.mp3": "I find that most suspicious. Were you not in that area recently?",
      "nm13aazhar19143_.mp3": "[Success] Hm, is that so... It is tragic that this had to happen to those families. Their children were in love, I hear.",
      "nm13aazhar19144_.mp3": "Perhaps it was Mandalorian raiders, or a feud that got out of control. It is tragic, but nothing can be done now that all who were involved are dead.",
      "nm13aazhar19145_.mp3": "Let this be a lesson against hate and violence: a Jedi must always be wary lest these lead to the dark side.",
      "nm13aazhar19148_.mp3": "[Success] Perhaps, perhaps. That or a feud that got out of control. It is tragic, but nothing can be done now that all who were involved are dead.",
      "nm13aazhar19149_.mp3": "Shen Matale and Rahasia Sandral have fled their feuding families and asked for sanctuary here in the Enclave. The Council has granted this request.",
      "nm13aazhar19150_.mp3": "I have heard that it was by your actions that they managed to escape, and I must congratulate you for avoiding a potentially dangerous situation.",
      "nm13aazhar19151_.mp3": "May the Force be with you in your quest.",
      "nm13aazhar19231_.mp3": "You must prove you have a Jedi's understanding of the Code. Return when you feel you are ready for this challenge."

      "nm01aac03001005_.mp3": "Bastila has turned to the dark side, Admiral. ## You have to give the order to retreat!",

      "nm13aaahla03001_.mp3": "The Council will look into this matter, Mr. Matale. You must be patient. Your accusations have no proof, and we do not want you stirring up trouble with the Sandrals if there is some mistake.",
      "nm13aaahla03005_.mp3": "As dangerous as the threat from Darth Malak and the Sith may be, we Jedi cannot simply abandon our other responsibilities. The Council has promised Alhan Matale we will look into his son's disappearance. ",

      "nm13aaahla03011_.mp3": "Your study and training are important, of course. But the Jedi are not a cloistered Order. Our influence and teachings must spread beyond the walls of our Academies. ",
      "nm13aaahla03016_.mp3": "These two families have been settled here for some years now...",
      "nm13aaahla03018_.mp3": "Indeed. They have been settled here for some time and feuding ever since.",

      "nm13aaahla03026_.mp3": "The Sandrals live far to the south. The head of that family is Nurik Sandral. He is a stern man, but I believe him fair. Under the present circumstances, though... who knows?",
      "nm13aaahla03027_.mp3": "Ahlan Matale can be much more unstable. He is convinced of his own importance and can be a most... oppressive individual at times. He lives closer to the enclave, but still to the south.",
      "nm13aaahla03028_.mp3": "Is there anything else you wished to know?",
      "nm13aaahla03030_.mp3": "Both families have settled to the south of this enclave. The Matales are the closer of the two.",
      "nm13aaahla03031_.mp3": "Both have similar estates, but Ahlan is much more paranoid about his and guards it quite heavily.",
      "nm13aaahla03032_.mp3": "Is there anything else you wish to know?",
      "nm13aavand17000_.mp3": "Bastila has told us of a most unusual development. She claims you and she have shared a dream, a vision of Malak and Revan in the ancient ruins here on Dantooine.",
      "nm13aavand17003_.mp3": "Bastila has described this shared dream to the Council in great detail. We feel it is more than a dream. It is a vision. The Force is acting through you as it acts through Bastila.",
      "nm13aavand17006_.mp3": "Whatever dangers may lie ahead, we cannot ignore the destiny that has brought you and Bastila here to us. Together. ",
      "nm13aavand17008_.mp3": "You and she are linked, as is your fate to hers. Together, you two may be able to stop Darth Malak and the Sith.",
      "nm13aavand17012_.mp3": "Understand that there is little choice in this matter, for you or us. Across the galaxy the numbers of our Order dwindle. We have sent many Jedi in quest of a way to thwart Malak's advance... many have not returned.",
      "nm13aavand17013_.mp3": "The Sith hunt the Jedi down like animals, ambushing and assassinating our brothers wherever they are found. We fear it is only a matter of time until they discover even this hidden refuge.",

      "nm13aavand17022_.mp3": "Before we send you to investigate the ruins, you must be trained in the ways of the Jedi so that you can resist the darkness within yourself... within all of us. Otherwise you are doomed to fail.",
      "nm13aavand17024_.mp3": "You must learn patience and discipline. The ruins are a place of corruption. The dark side is strong there. We cannot risk sending you there unprepared.",
      "nm13aavand17029_.mp3": "[Success] We must begin your training at once. You have a destiny upon you that you must be prepared to face. The entire fate of the galaxy is upon you.",

      "nm13aavand17044_.mp3": "Good. It is well that you see how important this is and have the devotion to follow it.",
      "nm13aavand17049_.mp3": "She says that she felt your presence within the dream, the presence she has felt within you ever since...",
      "nm13aavand17051_.mp3": "... ever since Taris. It is not unknown for this to happen between two people strong in the Force.",
      "nm13aavand17055_.mp3": "It is good to see Juhani has returned to the way of the light. You are to be commended for your role in this. Your actions give us great hope for the future. ",
      "nm13aavand17056_.mp3": "Go to Master Zhar and inform him that Juhani has returned to us. I think you may be nearing the end of your apprenticeship.",
      "nm13aavand17057_.mp3": "It is most regrettable that Juhani could not be saved. We in the Council had high hopes for her in the future.",
      "nm13aavand17058_.mp3": "In every heart there is some means of redemption. Could you find none in Juhani?",
      "nm13aavand17060_.mp3": "Perhaps that was the case. It is most regrettable, indeed.",
      "nm13aavand17061_.mp3": "Heed her example: all are susceptable to the lure of the dark side. We must always remain vigilant against it.",
      "nm13aavand17062_.mp3": "Go to Master Zhar and inform him that the grove has been cleansed. I think you may be nearing the end of your apprenticeship.",

      "nm13aavand17069_.mp3": "Good evening, apprentice. I trust your training goes well?",
      "nm13aavand17071_.mp3": "I have faith that you will achieve the rank of Padawan soon. Master Zhar is most impressed with your progress. May the Force be with you, apprentice.",

      "nm13aavand17074_.mp3": "There is no emotion; there is peace. There is no ignorance; there is knowledge. There is no passion; there is serenity. There is no chaos; there is harmony. There is no death; there is the Force.",

      "nm13aavand17078_.mp3": "Bastila will be a great Jedi someday. Even among the Masters and the Council it is rare to find one so skilled in the art of Battle Meditation. ",
      "nm13aavand17079_.mp3": "Bastila was there when Revan was slain. Did you know that?",
      "nm13aavand17081_.mp3": "Bastila herself does not like to talk about it. She was accompanying the strike team that confronted Revan when the Dark Lord was destroyed. Her role in the death of such a promising young Jedi as Revan upset her greatly. ",
      "nm13aavand17082_.mp3": "But Bastila knew she had to set her personal feelings aside for the sake of the galaxy and the Republic. The Force is strong with her now, and without her skill in Battle Meditation we would have lost this war long ago. ",
      "nm13aavand17083_.mp3": "The way ahead will be difficult for young Bastila... and for you. But you must draw strength from each other. May the Force be with you. ",
      "nm13aavand17084_.mp3": "Is there anything else you would like to know?",
      "nm13aavand17088_.mp3": "I knew Revan as a promising young pupil. Revan was strong in the Force, but also headstrong and proud. Such traits are not unusual in a Padawan. Perhaps that was why I did not see the true extent of the danger.",
      "nm13aavand17089_.mp3": "Many of the young Jedi admired Revan, including Malak. When Revan set off to challenge the Mandalorians, Malak was the first to join the cause.",
      "nm13aavand17091_.mp3": "And when Revan fell to the dark side it was inevitable Malak would fall as well.",
      "nm13aavand17093_.mp3": "Revan was always the leader, the more powerful of the pair. When Revan fell we had hoped the Sith threat was ended. But Malak quickly assumed Revan's role, and has embraced the dark side power as fully as his old master ever did.",
      "nm13aavand17094_.mp3": "Now Malak leads the Sith armada against the Republic. Hate and vengeance for his master's death draw Malak ever further down the path of the dark side, fueling his powers until they surpass those of his old master.",
      "nm13aavand17095_.mp3": "Only you and Bastila together can stop Malak now.",
      "nm13aavand17099_.mp3": "Master Vrook may seem harsh and critical, but he understands the dangers that lie in your path. He wants you and Bastila to be fully prepared when you finally face Lord Malak.",
      "nm13aavand17101_.mp3": "The Mandalorians have not hurt anyone before now. We thought they would keep their activities down with our presence here.",
      "nm13aavand17102_.mp3": "But it seems we were tragically wrong...",
      "nm13aavand17103_.mp3": "You may deal with the Mandalorian raiders should you meet them. It might be good training to test your fighting skills this way.",
      "nm13aavand17106_.mp3": "Very well. May the Force be with you.",
      "nm13aavand17107_.mp3": "There has been a report of a terrible battle near the Sandral estate to the south of the Enclave. Apparently a large force of droids attacked the estate.",
      "nm13aavand17108_.mp3": "The defending droids returned in kind. The attacking family was apparently the Matale family launching an attack on the Sandral estate.",
      "nm13aavand17109_.mp3": "Both entire families were slain, including the boy Shen who had been reported missing.",
      "nm13aavand17110_.mp3": "There was a mention that someone noticed one or more other persons leaving the battle area after the conflict had finished. You were in that area, were you not? Did you see something?",
      "nm13aavand17112_.mp3": "[Success] Is that so... I cannot find fault with your statement, but something in your manner is odd. But no matter, more pressing things are at hand.",
      "nm13aavand17113_.mp3": "You must always remember the destruction and chaos that the dark side can reap, and avoid it at all costs.",
      "nm13aavand17116_.mp3": "We have heard that there was a close confrontation between the Sandral and Matale families by one of the southern estates earlier. We also heard that it was by your actions that direct conflict was avoided.",
      "nm13aavand17117_.mp3": "It is good to hear that you have learned the lessons of the Jedi Order well enough to avoid conflict when necessary.",
      "nm13aavand17118_.mp3": "Rahasia Sandral and Shen Matale have come here seeking shelter against their families. The Council has decided to give it to them.",
      "nm13aavand17119_.mp3": "Their love for each other was being denied by overly possessive parents and we learned that it was only by your intervention that they managed to escape here.",
      "nm13aavand17120_.mp3": "While it is regrettable that the fences between the families were not repaired, it is good that these two young lovers can live their lives free of oppression.",
      "nm13aavand17121_.mp3": "I have heard that the Sandrals and Matales have agreed to cooperation in the construction of a new estate to house their children. Apparently a son of one family and the daughter of the other are getting married.",
      "nm13aavand17122_.mp3": "I also I hear that we have you to thank for this happy occurrence. I am glad that you are using the authority our Order wields to achieve some measure of good.",
      "nm13aavand17123_.mp3": "Ah, you have returned, young Padawan. Have you discovered what it was that Revan and Malak sought in those ruins?",
      "nm13aavand17125_.mp3": "This news of a Star Forge is disturbing. Action is required, but we must not do so in haste. We must discuss recent events in light of this new information. ",
      "nm13aavand17127_.mp3": "Return to your ship with Bastila and we will summon you when we are done.",
      "nm13aavand17130_.mp3": "Peace, Master Vrook. I'm certain the Padawan only meant they had not found anything beyond what Bastila would surely have told us.",
      "nm13aavand17131_.mp3": "Your training is now complete, young Padawan. And perhaps now it is time we dealt with the matter of the dream you and Bastila shared.",
      "nm13aavand17132_.mp3": "When we heard of the ruins in your dreams, Master Dorak recognized it as one of a series of ancient structures here on Dantooine. This one in particular lies to the east of this Enclave.",
      "nm13aavand17133_.mp3": "We sent a Jedi to investigate... but he has not returned. Perhaps sending him in the first place was a mistake.",
      "nm13aavand17134_.mp3": "The Force is guiding you through your visions; it may be that exploring the ruins is a task tied to your destiny. That is why the Council has now decided you should be the one to investigate this.",
      "nm13aavand17135_.mp3": "The secrets to stopping Malak may be hidden within those ruins. You must investigate them and find what Revan and Malak were looking for.",
      "nm13aavand17137_.mp3": "A Jedi must ever be seeking knowledge. What is it you wish to know?",
      "nm13aavand17139_.mp3": "Bastila will be a great Jedi someday. Even among the Masters and the Council it is rare to find one so skilled in the art of Battle Meditation. ",

      "nm13aavand17153_.mp3": "You should speak to Master Dorak after this council. As Chronicler of this Academy, he can give you more details of these events. But we must concern ourselves with the present.",
      "nm13aavand17154_.mp3": "Now Malak leads the Sith armada against the Republic, hate and vengeance drawing him ever further down the dark path, fueling his powers until they have surpassed those of his old Master.",
      "nm13aavand17155_.mp3": "Only you and Bastila together can stop Malak now.",
      "nm13aavand17159_.mp3": "Master Vrook may seem harsh and critical, but he understands the dangers that lie in your path. He wants you and Bastila to be fully prepared when you finally face Lord Malak.",
      "nm13aavand17161_.mp3": "If Shen Matale is not returned to his father it may ignite a savage and bloody feud between the Matale and Sandral estates. We must not allow that to happen.",
      "nm13aavand17162_.mp3": "You should ask Master Vrook about that, Padawan. He is in charge of our relations with the settlers.",
      "nm13aavand17163_.mp3": "The way ahead will be difficult for young Bastila... and for you. You must draw strength from each other. May the Force be with you. ",
      "nm13aavand17165_.mp3": "We do not know. She was training here until your unfortunate incident with Juhani, then she simply disappeared...",
      "nm13aavand17166_.mp3": "We would like any word of her you may bring. I do not believe she has died, or fallen prey to beasts, but I worry that she may have done something rash.",
      "nm13aavand17167_.mp3": "She had always been close to Juhani, and her death may have hit Belaya... hard.",
      "nm13aavand17168_.mp3": "Is there anything else you wish to ask?",
      "nm13aavand17170_.mp3": "Be sure to bring Bastila with you. There is a powerful link between you, and you will need to draw strength from each other during the trials ahead.",
      "nm13aavand17172_.mp3": "We do not know. That is one of the things you must investigate. We... fear the worst.",
      "nm13aavand17173_.mp3": "Is there anything else you want to know?",
      "nm13aavand17175_.mp3": "That is most... unfortunate. She was always a model student and most eager to learn. I grieve that she had fallen to her passions.",
      "nm13aavand17176_.mp3": "Remember her example as well as that of Juhani: the dark side is not an enemy to be taken lightly.",
      "nm13aavand17177_.mp3": "Padawan, you have done well in discovering the Star Map hidden within the ancient ruins. But there is more you must do in the battle against Malak and the Sith.",
      "nm13aavand17178_.mp3": "We Jedi know victory over the Sith will not come through martial might. The Council has a mission for you, Padawan.",
      "nm13aavand17181_.mp3": "The Star Map in the ruins showed you four planets, but it was incomplete. It did not show the location of the Star Forge itself. We believe there may be similar Star Maps on other planets.",
      "nm13aavand17182_.mp3": "Each Star Map is likely a small piece of a larger puzzle. Find the Star Maps on Kashyyyk, Tatooine, Manaan and Korriban and we believe they will lead you to the Star Forge.",
      "nm13aavand17184_.mp3": "The Jedi numbers have been ravaged by this war, by defections to Malak's cause and by Sith assassins. But we realize the importance of this mission.",
      "nm13aavand17185_.mp3": "Yet if we sent a company of Jedi Knights with you we would surely draw the full attention of Malak and the Sith, dooming your efforts to failure.",
      "nm13aavand17187_.mp3": "Secrecy is our best defense against the Sith, but it would be foolish to send you on this quest without someone to aid you, young Padawan.",
      "nm13aavand17188_.mp3": "Bastila will accompany you, for there is a powerful connection between you two... a connection that might be the key to unraveling the mysteries uncovered by Revan. ",
      "nm13aavand17189_.mp3": "And Juhani has also asked to accompany you. After long deliberation we have granted her request.",
      "nm13aavand17192_.mp3": "Of course those who aided you on Taris will also come; they possess skills you may find useful in your quest. Remember that secrecy and discretion are paramount to your success.",
      "nm13aavand17193_.mp3": "You will not be able to hide the fact that you are Jedi, nor should you. But the true nature of your mission must not reach Malak's ears.",
      "nm13aavand17194_.mp3": "You may return here at any time. Dantooine will be a sanctuary for you, a safe haven. Here you can find supplies and whatever advice or other aid we may give you. ",

      "nm22aajano06058_.mp3": "[Force Persuade] You wish to tell us more about this agreement with the Wookiee leadership.",
      "nm22aajano06094_.mp3": "Slavery under any guise should not be tolerated!",
      "nm22aazaal01053_.mp3": "It is always good to know as much as possible about a world, and to have a reliable guide. Perhaps we should get Zaalbar to accompany us.",
      "nm22aazaal01055_.mp3": "A reliable guide through the intricate complexities of another culture can be invaluable.",

      "nm22abzaal01027_.mp3": "This place is wild and untamed. It stirs the blood and makes one feel alive. It is a shame the Wookiee is not here with us; I have no doubt he would feel the same way.",

      "nm35aajuha11007_.mp3": "Thank you... It is most reassuring to know that you can forgive me, even though I tried to take your life.",
      "nm35aajuha11009_.mp3": "It may. But I am prepared to do what it takes.",
      "nm35aajuha11010_.mp3": "I can only hope that, in our time journeying together, I will succeed.",

      "nm35aajuha11013_.mp3": "I will prove myself to you and to everyone! I will be a faithful companion to you and Bastila as long as our journey may last.",
      "nm35aajuha11015_.mp3": "I realize you have justification, but that anger only leads to the dark side. Please do not fall into the same trap that caught me.",
      "nm35aajuha11017_.mp3": "The dark side is most devious and deceptive. It can find the smallest weakness to exploit.",
      "nm35aajuha11019_.mp3": "I thought that too. But I was wrong...",
      "nm35aajuha11021_.mp3": "How... how can you possibly be Revan?",
      "nm35aajuha11022_.mp3": "The one... the Jedi whose troops saved me on Taris... It was Revan, leading an army out to defeat the Mandalorians. It was you...",
      "nm35aajuha11023_.mp3": "You are nothing like the one who saved me on Taris.",
      "nm35aajuha11025_.mp3": "You are obviously not who I thought you were, once upon a time.",
      "nm35aajuha11026_.mp3": "I thought you were the ideal Jedi. I thought you would never turn against us. Yet here you are.",
      "nm35aajuha11028_.mp3": "You did turn in the end. I did not want to believe it. But now I suppose you have a chance to redeem yourself.",
      "nm35aajuha11029_.mp3": "You can work with us. For the Republic. For the Order. We can set right what you started so long ago.",
      "nm35aajuha11031_.mp3": "Yes we shall. I only hope that you will see this through until the end.",
      "nm35aajuha11032_.mp3": "Time will tell what choices you make. I shall stay by you to see this task done.",
      "nm35aajuha11034_.mp3": "And I hope that what you see as necessary is what we originally set out to do.",
      "nm35aajuha11036_.mp3": "Only through serving the Republic do you serve yourself as well. In defeating Malak you save all of us along with you.",
      "nm35aajuha11041_.mp3": "I knew when I heard that you had become the Dark Lord of the Sith that something was wrong with it.",
      "nm35aajuha11042_.mp3": "The man who saved me could never go completely to the dark side.",
      "nm35aajuha11046_.mp3": "The woman who saved me, who I... I have come to care for, could never go completely to the dark side.",
      "nm35aajuha11047_.mp3": "The woman who saved me, who I... who I have come to admire, could never go completely to the dark side.",
      "nm35aajuha11050_.mp3": "It is good to know that you have truly changed. It gives me hope.",
      "nm35aajuha11051_.mp3": "I do not think now that I will fall to the dark side. I only have to look to you and follow by your example and there is no way I can fail.",
      "nm35aajuha11053_.mp3": "Yes. That is true. I suppose you would know better than I.",
      "nm35aajuha11055_.mp3": "Thank you for placing your confidence in me. I only wish I had your heart as well...",
      "nm35aajuha11056_.mp3": "I will never forget what you did for me, even if you do not remember it.",
      "nm35aajuha11057_.mp3": "That is especially meaningful coming from you.",
      "nm35aajuha11059_.mp3": "I... I am sorry, I did not realize. I will endeavor to be more considerate in the future.",
      "nm35aajuha11060_.mp3": "This may be the last time I will have a chance to talk to you...",
      "nm35aajuha11061_.mp3": "I just want you to know that I... that I...",
      "nm35aajuha11063_.mp3": "I... I... I care for you. I do not know why. I do not know if anything will be possible or if you even return what I feel, but I do know it is there.",
      "nm35aajuha11064_.mp3": "I am sorry if this upsets you. I am so sorry if I am wrong, but I cannot deny what it is that I feel.",
      "nm35aajuha11066_.mp3": "Now that I have put myself in this position, I know not what to say.",
      "nm35aajuha11068_.mp3": "Yes. I thank you.",
      "nm35aajuha11070_.mp3": "Yes. I thank you.",
      "nm35aajuha11071_.mp3": "But as much as I may care for you, and you for me, first we must deal with Malak.",
      "nm35aajuha11072_.mp3": "After there will be time to sort things out between us.",
      "nm35aajuha11075_.mp3": "I... I understand. You have someone somewhere... or I just do not seem to appeal to you.",
      "nm35aajuha11076_.mp3": "I am sorry for pushing myself on you. I apologize for my actions.",
      "nm35aajuha11077_.mp3": "I suggest we find and confront Malak as soon as possible to remove the threat to the Republic once and for all.",
      "nm35aajuha11079_.mp3": "I was afraid that I would have no more time to say it... I wonder if all of us wil survive what we must do...",
      "nm35aajuha11081_.mp3": "But I feel I must. I have never said this before...",
      "nm35aajuha11083_.mp3": "Of.. Of course. I am sorry. I should have known better.",
      "nm35aajuha11084_.mp3": "I can only say that if I am going to die, as we stand likely to, I am glad that it will be you beside whom I do it.",
      "nm35aajuha11085_.mp3": "I just want to thank you for all that you have done for me. For saving me from the dark side, for accepting me on your journey.",
      "nm35aajuha11087_.mp3": "It is good to know that I have been of some value...",
      "nm35aajuha11088_.mp3": "Even if not as much as I would like...",
      "nm35aajuha11089_.mp3": "I will prove my true worth to you.",
      "nm35aajuha11090_.mp3": "We WILL defeat Malak and save the Republic from the Sith threat once and for all!",
      "nm35aajuha11094_.mp3": "I... defer to your wisdom in this matter. I have little knowledge of the true power of the Sith.",
      "nm35aajuha11095_.mp3": "I pledge my life to your cause. I will stand by you until the end.",
      "nm35aajuha11097_.mp3": "I will help you in any way I can.",
      "nm35aajuha11099_.mp3": "So here we are... in the belly of the beast.",
      "nm35aajuha11101_.mp3": "Here we are in a Sith Interdicter loaded with troops and Sith Jedi, and you wonder at my apprehension?",
      "nm35aajuha11102_.mp3": "Knowledge of the almost certainty of my death tends to make me introspective.",
      "nm35aajuha11103_.mp3": "I wish that I had more time to turn you from the path you seem to have chosen.",
      "nm35aajuha11105_.mp3": "I wonder if that is true. For your sake, I hope that it is.",
      "nm35aajuha11107_.mp3": "If you will not listen to me, then to who? I respect your abilities, and I... I care for you...",
      "nm35aajuha11108_.mp3": "If you will not listen to me, then to who? I admire you greatly, and respect your abilities...",
      "nm35aajuha11110_.mp3": "I hope that is true. Truly, I do.",
      "nm35aajuha11111_.mp3": "But you have also fallen far from the ideals of the Jedi Order. Can you still do what is required of you?",
      "nm35aajuha11113_.mp3": "Your conviction is... compelling. But also disturbing.",
      "nm35aajuha11115_.mp3": "Your steadfast desire for vengeance credits your perseverence, but I fear for you. It is too easy to give in completely to the dark side.",
      "nm35aajuha11116_.mp3": "I know I worry too much, and I know you may be irritated by my saying this, but do not fall the way I did. You have so much potential, I do not want you to waste it.",
      "nm35aajuha11117_.mp3": "But there is enough to worry about without my making it worse. Perhaps we can speak more of this later, once we leave this ship.",
      "nm35aajuha11119_.mp3": "If I am going to die here then, I am glad to have stood by you.",
      "nm35aajuha11121_.mp3": "I do not favor our chances at all. But if you believe that we can... then maybe there is a possibility.",
      "nm35aajuha11122_.mp3": "Live or die, I shall stand by you as you need me.",
      "nm35aajuha11124_.mp3": "I only wish that we had had more time... together...",
      "nm35aajuha11126_.mp3": "It is too late to do anything now. We must do what we can to escape from here.",
      "nm35aajuha11127_.mp3": "When we have left, perhaps then we can see what the future holds for us.",
      "nm35aajuha11130_.mp3": "Live or die, I shall stand by you as you need me.",
      "nm35aajuha11132_.mp3": "Yes. Yes, we should. Your focus on your work does you credit.",
      "nm35aajuha11133_.mp3": "Let us leave this place then... If we can.",
      "nm35aajuha11135_.mp3": "We are in a Sith Interdicter loaded with troops and Sith Jedi. I am not favoring of our chances.",
      "nm35aajuha11137_.mp3": "How... reassuring. I, though, would not have liked to die quite so soon.",
      "nm35aajuha11138_.mp3": "My Cathar blood seethes at the thought of that man still running free. I cannot stand still while I think about it, but... but I will not give in to the dark side either.",
      "nm35aajuha11139_.mp3": "He will pay for his crimes, though. He will most likely be following us... me. If we could find him first, then he may not be able to set in motion whatever he has in store for us.",
      "nm35aajuha11140_.mp3": "That man was a beast! A monster! I am glad that the galaxy is now rid of him, so that he may not harm others again.",
      "nm35aajuha11141_.mp3": "I do regret, though, that he did not die by my hand...",
      "nm35aajuha11143_.mp3": "I know. But must I always fear the lure of the dark side?",
      "nm35aajuha11144_.mp3": "But... it was for the best. I am glad that you stood by my side during this.",
      "nm35aajuha11145_.mp3": "We should continue our journeys now. No reason for staying here for this.",
      "nm35aajuha11148_.mp3": "I... I do not know anymore what I am strong enough for. I only take what comes to me and hope that I can handle it.",
      "nm35aajuha11149_.mp3": "The lure of the dark side will always be my strongest foe. I should have killed him.",
      "nm35aajuha11150_.mp3": "I felt statisfaction taking revenge for my people like that... but... but I should not have let my anger consume me so.",
      "nm35aajuha11152_.mp3": "But I could have! I should have...",
      "nm35aajuha11153_.mp3": "I must try harder in the future to resist the call of the dark side. I suppose I am fortunate that, in this case, he was deserving of such an end.",
      "nm35aajuha11155_.mp3": "Yes... Yes I do. I must try harder in the future to resist such urges. I suppose I am fortunate that, in this case, he was deserving of such an end.",
      "nm35aajuha11156_.mp3": "We should continue on our way. I do not want to linger around here anymore.",
      "nm35aajuha11158_.mp3": "No I didn't. I let my anger and passion consume me and did something rash. Something which leads me down the path to the dark side.",
      "nm35aajuha11159_.mp3": "But... I recognize this, and I am truly regretful that I committed this act. I shall not let it happen again.",
      "nm35aajuha11160_.mp3": "I suppose I was fortunate that, in this case, he was deserving of such an end.",
      "nm35aajuha11161_.mp3": "I have been watching you... and I cannot help but feel that you are becoming more distant.",
      "nm35aajuha11162_.mp3": "When we met it was you that convinced me to turn away from the lure of the dark side. But now it seems that you are falling into the trap that had caught me.",
      "nm35aajuha11164_.mp3": "No. Please. I must speak.",
      "nm35aajuha11165_.mp3": "When we first met I looked at you with contempt. You were some insect sent by the Jedi Council to eliminate me.",
      "nm35aajuha11166_.mp3": "But you were more powerful than I would ever have thought. It seemed so easy for you to overcome me.",
      "nm35aajuha11168_.mp3": "I think that you flatter me again, and I do not know why. I worry for you.",
      "nm35aajuha11169_.mp3": "I look and I see you turning away from the Code of the Jedi. I wonder if you can see it.",
      "nm35aajuha11171_.mp3": "That you did. You took away the dark taint that had been consuming me and restored me to the light. You took me away from there.",
      "nm35aajuha11172_.mp3": "But now... now I wonder what it is that you see in your own reflection.",
      "nm35aajuha11174_.mp3": "And this is just the problem! You seem to revel in your power, use it far too frequently for your own gain.",
      "nm35aajuha11175_.mp3": "I... I do not know... I fear that you may be starting to fall.",
      "nm35aajuha11176_.mp3": "If only there were some way I could turn you away from the path that you seem to be headed down...",
      "nm35aajuha11177_.mp3": "I wonder if it started when you met me in that grove. I wonder if it could be my fault.",
      "nm35aajuha11179_.mp3": "That is true. But still I worry about the ones you make.",
      "nm35aajuha11180_.mp3": "But I have faith in you. I would follow you into battle with Malak himself. I will stand by your side.",
      "nm35aajuha11182_.mp3": "I wish I could believe that as you do.",
      "nm35aajuha11184_.mp3": "Maybe I do. I have had reason to wonder recently if I have had any effect at all...",
      "nm35aajuha11187_.mp3": "I... I have been watching you for some time. I wonder if you have noticed.",
      "nm35aajuha11188_.mp3": "I have been thinking of how far I had fallen, and how you exemplify the Code of the Jedi. I find my self ashamed.",
      "nm35aajuha11190_.mp3": "That I had so easily fallen to the dark side. That I could convince myself that by injuring my master I became a great force of evil in the galaxy.",
      "nm35aajuha11191_.mp3": "For my pride, my hubris. For the inner rage that all of my species feels. Sometimes I wish that I had not been born this way...",
      "nm35aajuha11193_.mp3": "I am sorry. I start to talk thinking about how you stay strong to the path of virtue and justice, and I find myself whining again about my own inadequacies.",
      "nm35aajuha11194_.mp3": "The Council would be proud to see that you had learned your lessons so well.",
      "nm35aajuha11195_.mp3": "... As am I.",
      "nm35aajuha11199_.mp3": "But I have so little to show when I compare myself to you... and that makes my shame even worse...",
      "nm35aajuha11201_.mp3": "Your power in the Force is strong, and I can sense no taint of the dark side in you. That makes my shame even worse...",
      "nm35aajuha11202_.mp3": "I have been thinking about our journey together, and how we are more similar than I had first thought.",
      "nm35aajuha11204_.mp3": "I know how hard it was for me to resist the call of the dark side, and I know that you have suffered those pains as well.",
      "nm35aajuha11205_.mp3": "The continual struggle between restraint and freedom... light and darkness. It is hard for me with my Cathar blood to resist sometimes.",
      "nm35aajuha11207_.mp3": "I do resist. I look to you and see that we are in this together, and that you are resisting as well. That gives me strength.",
      "nm35aajuha11208_.mp3": "I think the Jedi Council would be proud to see that you are holding up so well in spite of the hardships you have endured.",
      "nm35aajuha11209_.mp3": "... As am I.",
      "nm35aajuha11213_.mp3": "But similar enough. We have had many of the same sort of experiences.",
      "nm35aajuha11215_.mp3": "Heh. I did not mean in appearances, but we have had some of the same experiences.",
      "nm35aajuha11216_.mp3": "Yes? What is it?",
      "nm35aajuha11218_.mp3": "Dantooine? Dantooine has been my home for a number of years, ever since I started my training with the Jedi.",
      "nm35aajuha11219_.mp3": "It is a lightly populated planet, mostly focused on agriculture and hunting of the wild beasts that roam its plains.",
      "nm35aajuha11220_.mp3": "The most populous form of animals on its surface are the iriaz, herd beasts that are normally quite tame, but can be violent when provoked, and the kath hounds, vicious pack predators.",
      "nm35aajuha11221_.mp3": "Kath hounds do not normally attack people except when it is a pack of them ambushing a lone individual. But recently they have been much more aggressive.",

      "nm35aajuha11224_.mp3": "Is there anything else you need?",
      "nm35aajuha11225_.mp3": "Manaan is a water-rich world... as you may have been able to tell.",

      "nm35aajuha11227_.mp3": "The dominant indigenous race of the world are the Selkath, a semi-aquatic bipedal species. They are known to be very dreary and strong proponents of the power of law above all else.",

      "nm35aajuha11232_.mp3": "They hope in this way to make themselves too valuable to both to be conquered. As a last resort, they have made it clear to both sides that any attempt to attack their world will force them to destroy the Kolto supply entirely.",
      "nm35aajuha11233_.mp3": "Any violation by either the Republic or the Sith of their sacrosanct laws incurs severe Kolto export restrictions on the violating government.",

      "nm35aajuha11235_.mp3": "Many people speak highly of the integrity of the Selkath people... but from what little I have seen of them, they are disgusting little fish-people. But I suppose I just have too high standards.",
      "nm35aajuha11238_.mp3": "I am sorry, but I do not know anything about this place. It truly is an unknown world to me. I would be surprised if anyone at all in the Republic knew of it.",
      "nm35aajuha11239_.mp3": "We should be on our guard at all times.",
      "nm35aajuha11240_.mp3": "Korriban, I have heard, is a mysterious world. It is rumored to hold many ancient ruins of a purpose that none have been able to discover.",
      "nm35aajuha11241_.mp3": "There are also tales of strange ghosts and monsters haunting the ruins, whispering in the ears of all who would listen and driving them mad.",
      "nm35aajuha11242_.mp3": "The Jedi are not welcome here, however, so we cannot determine the truth that may lie in these rumors.",
      "nm35aajuha11243_.mp3": "Korriban remains staunchly outside the Republic, and we suspect that the Sith may have spread their influence here as well. The large Czerka Corporation outpost also points towards that.",
      "nm35aajuha11244_.mp3": "If the Czerka Corp. is the industrial arms of the Sith Empire, then judging by the size of their facilities here, this may be a very dangerous world indeed.",
      "nm35aajuha11245_.mp3": "We must watch ourselves closely here.",
      "nm35aajuha11246_.mp3": "Tatooine is a filthy desert. Planets such as this should not be fit for life at all. My skin itches just to be here.",
      "nm35aajuha11247_.mp3": "As you can see, it is a desert. Very little water. Too much sand. This sort of place attracts too much of the seedier side of civilization.",
      "nm35aajuha11248_.mp3": "As to the particulars of this world itself, I can safely say that it holds no interest for me, and I will be well pleased when we leave here and never return.",
      "nm35aajuha11249_.mp3": "Now is there something else, or may we hurry and do what we have to do here as quickly as possible?",
      "nm35aajuha11250_.mp3": "I have heard of this world... Kashyyyk. It is a place of giant trees that have overgrown the entire world, blanketing it in greenery.",
      "nm35aajuha11251_.mp3": "But while it is beautiful to behold at times, it can also be quite deadly. Many creatures and predators lurk in the leaves and branches. Some small, some undoubtedly quite large.",
      "nm35aajuha11252_.mp3": "I have heard that the bottom layers of the trees have never been seen by a living being who returned to tell of it, and that travelling there is certain death. I do not envy any who go there.",
      "nm35aajuha11253_.mp3": "It is most odd that Revan came here, but perhaps in the vast canopy of one of these trees we may find another piece of the Star Map.",
      "nm35aajuha11254_.mp3": "I have heard of no indigenous race that inhabits this world, but I must profess my ignorance, since I have only heard its name in passing.",
      "nm35aajuha11256_.mp3": "I... have been bothered by something of late...",
      "nm35aajuha11258_.mp3": "I never told you where I came from, did I? Where I grew up as a child? I suppose I was trying to deny what I was feeling.",
      "nm35aajuha11260_.mp3": "I have been wrestling with my feelings inside. Trying to come to terms with it, but I find I cannot. I must have someone to blame!",
      "nm35aajuha11261_.mp3": "Someone to blame for the destruction of my homeworld. Someone who is responsible for the death of everyone I have ever known except those on Dantooine!",
      "nm35aajuha11263_.mp3": "You self centered fool! To think that I would desire to mate with one such as you, should that even be possible!",
      "nm35aajuha11264_.mp3": "You are the center of the universe, what does it matter if my homeworld was wiped out by your actions! Who cares if it is because of you that everyone I knew as a child is dead!",
      "nm35aajuha11267_.mp3": "Fine! Then I will not! What does it matter to you if my homeworld was wiped out by your actions! Who cares if it is because of you that everyone I knew as a child is dead!",
      "nm35aajuha11269_.mp3": "Taris! It was Taris that the Sith destroyed to try to kill you and your precious Bastila! Taris, my homeworld!",
      "nm35aajuha11271_.mp3": "If it were not for you and Bastila, the Sith would have never had reason to destroy that world! It was your fault for being there, and your fault for rescuing Bastila!",
      "nm35aajuha11272_.mp3": "Without your intervention the Sith would have had no cause to lay waste to my childhood!",
      "nm35aajuha11274_.mp3": "Just let me vent my anger! I need someone to blame... something... anything!",
      "nm35aajuha11275_.mp3": "I hated that world, yet everything I learned as a child I learned there. It is as much a part of me as the air I breathe.",
      "nm35aajuha11276_.mp3": "I have this ache inside me where all my childhood memories lay, and I find your face there with them. If it was not for you, that world would still exist!",
      "nm35aajuha11278_.mp3": "I... I know... I suppose I realized that.",
      "nm35aajuha11279_.mp3": "But it is so hard to lose your entire past. You would not understand.",
      "nm35aajuha11281_.mp3": "Yes... Yes I suppose it will. As long as we remain focused on our task it will.",
      "nm35aajuha11282_.mp3": "I am sorry. I will try not to distract you in the future with my trivial experiences. We should stop for now.",
      "nm35aajuha11284_.mp3": "I suppose that is to be expected. Everything will turn out for the best as long as we remain focused on our task.",
      "nm35aajuha11286_.mp3": "There is no emotion. There is peace.",
      "nm35aajuha11287_.mp3": "... I suppose you did what you had to... and it could not have been avoided. The Republic needs you and Bastila. Maybe needs you more than it needed Taris.",
      "nm35aajuha11292_.mp3": "Oh yes, I have been told all about her vaunted powers with the Force. Her Battle Meditation that can turn the tide of any conflict.",
      "nm35aajuha11293_.mp3": "Well if it could, then why could Taris not have been saved?",
      "nm35aajuha11295_.mp3": "What did you think would happen by aiding the Republic?",
      "nm35aajuha11297_.mp3": "The sacrifice of an entire world is too much for any cause! How would you feel if Dantooine or Alderaan or somesuch world were destroyed?",
      "nm35aajuha11298_.mp3": "Would you be so callous then?",
      "nm35aajuha11301_.mp3": "It was my home!",
      "nm35aajuha11304_.mp3": "Taris! It was Taris that the Sith destroyed to try to kill you and your precious Bastila! Taris, my homeworld! Not that you care!",
      "nm35aajuha11305_.mp3": "You... you animal! It is only because of the Council's will that I stay with you. But if you betray us, I may decide that falling to the dark side will be a small price to pay for letting my anger run loose.",
      "nm35aajuha11307_.mp3": "Someone else is not responsible for wiping out my homeworld by their actions. But who cares if it is because of you that everyone I have ever known off Dantooine is dead!",
      "nm35aajuha11308_.mp3": "Someone else is not responsible for wiping out my homeworld by their actions. But who cares if it is because of you that everyone I have ever known off Dantooine is dead!",
      "nm35aajuha11309_.mp3": "I was remembering Taris...",
      "nm35aajuha11311_.mp3": "No, it is alright. I think I am over the worst of it. I apologize again for lashing out at you. It was not your fault.",
      "nm35aajuha11313_.mp3": "It was a horrible place to have to live. At least in the lower cities where the non-humans tended to get relegated.",
      "nm35aajuha11314_.mp3": "Living for years in a place with no sun, living off the trash dropped from the upper levels, and the meager pay doing back-breaking labor.",
      "nm35aajuha11316_.mp3": "There was always the danger of rakghouls coming up from the sewers, or more mundane predators living and working in the area.",
      "nm35aajuha11317_.mp3": "My family and I struggled each and every day to make something of our lives, but we could only go so far.",
      "nm35aajuha11318_.mp3": "Taxes from the corrupt government, more fees from the gangs controlling the streets, and whatever was left paying for what food and medical supplies we could afford.",
      "nm35aajuha11320_.mp3": "With no money to spare for any amenities, even the Enclave on Dantooine seems a paradise in comparison.",
      "nm35aajuha11321_.mp3": "And of course there was the constant bigotry and hate from the more affluent and human citizens. Lording their wealth over us living below.",
      "nm35aajuha11322_.mp3": "Every once in a while a rich human would come down through the lower levels with his droid entourage just to see how the 'wildlife' lived... and laughed at the mockeries that were our successes.",
      "nm35aajuha11323_.mp3": "But I have come to meet many decent humans in my travels since those days. Indeed, some of the greatest people I have ever met are human.",
      "nm35aajuha11325_.mp3": "The... the Jedi who encouraged me to join the Order, the one who was with the group going to fight the Mandalorians, she was human.",
      "nm35aajuha11326_.mp3": "I... I suppose I see something of her in you when I look...",
      "nm35aajuha11327_.mp3": "I am sorry... I am getting away from my point. If there even was one...",
      "nm35aajuha11328_.mp3": "Sometimes I curse the day my parents fled to Taris. But then again, if they had not, I would not be where I am today.",
      "nm35aajuha11330_.mp3": "Another story for another time. For now we must continue our own epic: To save the galaxy, if we can.",
      "nm35aajuha11336_.mp3": "I have noticed that. But the Jedi order seems to have collected a fair number.",
      "nm35aajuha11339_.mp3": "It did not. But only because of the Jedi who came. It was very bad.",
      "nm35aajuha11343_.mp3": "There were none. Bad enough to be a race that is feared and hated by humans, but to be one that is strange and different even among non-humans?",
      "nm35aajuha11344_.mp3": "But living was hard enough without the stigma of being from a lost race.",
      "nm35aajuha11346_.mp3": "You mock my pain! It was a horrible place to live... we had to go through hell every day just to survive, and you think it bothering me is an irritation?!",
      "nm35aajuha11347_.mp3": "Your insensitivity speaks ill of your qualities as a Jedi. Still, as the Council ordered me to do, I shall accompany you, but expect no great sympathy for your plights.",
      "nm35aajuha11348_.mp3": "I am thinking of what happened on Korriban...",
      "nm35aajuha11349_.mp3": "I am appalled at the things the Sith did there.",
      "nm35aajuha11350_.mp3": "I cannot help but notice that your manner is increasingly like that of the Sith...",
      "nm35aajuha11352_.mp3": "But I do not believe it was. We should have been able to find another way.",
      "nm35aajuha11353_.mp3": "I should have helped you find another path. I should have tried harder to stop you.",
      "nm35aajuha11355_.mp3": "And I am sure that is exactly the same justification that Malak and Revan used before they fell...",
      "nm35aajuha11357_.mp3": "Your overconfidence may yet be your downfall. I will still stand by your side, though.",
      "nm35aajuha11358_.mp3": "I only wish that what I see meant more to you... that I could turn you back...",
      "nm35aajuha11359_.mp3": "Will you try? ... For me?",
      "nm35aajuha11362_.mp3": "I... see.",
      "nm35aajuha11363_.mp3": "I will still stand by you, as I have said before. I can only hope that when the time comes, you will do what is right.",
      "nm35aajuha11365_.mp3": "Thank you. I am sure we can succeed together.",
      "nm35aajuha11366_.mp3": "I can only hope that when the time comes, you will do what is right.",
      "nm35aajuha11371_.mp3": "Maybe you should have... The fact that you think so gives me hope.",
      "nm35aajuha11372_.mp3": "I hope that you will return to path of the Jedi... to me.",
      "nm35aajuha11374_.mp3": "I am your companion. I am a fellow Jedi. I only seek to ensure the success of our mission.",
      "nm35aajuha11376_.mp3": "To see such horrible, warped rituals that the Sith practice... It is unnerving.",
      "nm35aajuha11377_.mp3": "I can truly see now why we must defeat Malak as quickly as possible; to prevent that sort of society from consuming the entire galaxy.",
      "nm35aajuha11378_.mp3": "It angers me to think of it.",
      "nm35aajuha11382_.mp3": "Yes... yes, I understand: Do not let my passions and impulses rule me. Remain calm and serene.",
      "nm35aajuha11383_.mp3": "But I fear that when I am confronted with these monsters I will lose myself.",
      "nm35aajuha11384_.mp3": "I think that I may yet fall to the dark side by the very desire to fight it.",
      "nm35aajuha11386_.mp3": "Yes, it could be... if you look at it callously enough. But I cannot.",
      "nm35aajuha11388_.mp3": "I know, I should not worry. I am grateful for your support in this matter.",
      "nm35aajuha11389_.mp3": "It seems that whenever I have a problem I turn to you. Sometimes... sometimes I almost seem to want problems, just for the chance...",
      "nm35aajuha11390_.mp3": "But I am sorry, I should not speak of this.",
      "nm35aajuha11391_.mp3": "It is a relief to have someone to turn to when I am feeling uncertain.",
      "nm35aajuha11394_.mp3": "Of course. I will assist you as I am able.",
      "nm35aajuha11395_.mp3": "How may I be of assistance to you, Padawan?",
      "nm35aajuha11397_.mp3": "Dantooine? Dantooine has been my home for a number of years, ever since I started my training with the Jedi.",
      "nm35aajuha11398_.mp3": "It is a lightly populated planet, mostly focused on agriculture and hunting of the wild beasts that roam its plains.",
      "nm35aajuha11399_.mp3": "The most populous form of animals on its surface are the iriaz, herd beasts that are normally quite tame, but can be violent when provoked, and the kath hounds, vicious pack predators.",
      "nm35aajuha11400_.mp3": "Kath hounds do not normally attack people except when it is a pack of them ambushing a lone individual. But recently they have been much more aggressive.",
      "nm35aajuha11401_.mp3": "I am to blame for that, I believe.",
      "nm35aajuha11402_.mp3": "But enough of my self-recrimination, I should not dwell on the past, but rather look to the future.",
      "nm35aajuha11403_.mp3": "How may I be of further assistance to you, Padawan?",
      "nm35aajuha11404_.mp3": "Manaan is a water-rich world... as you may have been able to tell.",
      "nm35aajuha11405_.mp3": "With the exception of this Ahto city, there is no land on the world protruding above sea-level.",

      "nm35aajuha11445_.mp3": "It was serious enough to him... and to me, for I did not wish to hurt him. I had little choice in the matter.",
      "nm35aajuha11446_.mp3": "He was angry at my refusal. I... assumed that he would get over the hurt in time. I suppose such feelings can fester and darken, and they never go away.",

      "nm35aajuha11448_.mp3": "But he has chosen his path, hasn't he? If I thought he would accept an offer of help, I would give it. Let us... just move on, please.",

      "nm35aajuha11456_.mp3": "But we had heard of them. Well, everyone had, so that is not to be unexpected.",
      "nm35aajuha11457_.mp3": "Champions of truth. Defenders of justice. Heroes of the Republic.",
      "nm35aajuha11458_.mp3": "It was very easy for a child to be enthralled by their image, their mystique. Maybe I was one of those children.",

      "nm35aajuha11470_.mp3": "From that moment on I knew that I would have to try to become a Jedi. To lift myself out of the rut I had been living in for years and to make a real difference, as the Jedi were.",
      "nm35aajuha11471_.mp3": "The foolish delusions of a child. But THIS child made it happen!",
      "nm35aajuha11472_.mp3": "As soon as I was able I left my world and went in search of them. I found them and was accepted. I had been living my dream on Dantooine for several years before you came.",
      "nm35aajuha11473_.mp3": "Although... perhaps I was not entirely ready for it... or not completely suited to the task. Otherwise I would not have fallen...",
      "nm35aajuha11474_.mp3": "But thanks to you I have been redeemed. Perhaps I may yet live to see that dream of mine come true.",
      "nm35aajuha11475_.mp3": "Come, there is much we should do. Let us not waste time talking. Action is what is needed.",
      "nm35aajuha11477_.mp3": "It was not the homeworld of the Cathar that I lived on. My parents had long fled from that place, and perhaps that is a story for another time. Rather it was a human hive-world I was raised on.",
      "nm35aajuha11479_.mp3": "Bad enough that Jedi rarely came to that place.",
      "nm35aajuha11481_.mp3": "Very well then. Perhaps some other time you might deign to be interested.",
      "nm35aajuha11483_.mp3": "My attempt at humility seems to fail around you. So be it then, go immerse yourself in something else.",
      "nm35aajuha11485_.mp3": "Well... I suppose I have not talked very much about the Jedi I met back home.",
      "nm35aajuha11486_.mp3": "They, all of them, were so very... invigorating.",
      "nm35aajuha11488_.mp3": "They were so very alive. So full of hope and energy and zeal.",
      "nm35aajuha11489_.mp3": "In retrospect I can see it was a little bit tragic...",
      "nm35aajuha11491_.mp3": "Well... yes... these Jedi were going to fight the Mandalorians just after they had invaded. Many of those Jedi perished in the fighting.",
      "nm35aajuha11492_.mp3": "But to us, they seemed invincible, especially their leader, who they talked about all the time. Paragons of light and justice, sweeping away all iniquity before them.",
      "nm35aajuha11493_.mp3": "It was like looking at gods...",
      "nm35aajuha11495_.mp3": "I know that! I was using poetic licence! But those Jedi...",
      "nm35aajuha11496_.mp3": "They were enthralling... Everyone wanted just to touch them. Some people thought it would bring them luck.",
      "nm35aajuha11497_.mp3": "Not that the peace they brought lasted very long...",
      "nm35aajuha11499_.mp3": "The Jedi left. The people grew complacent. Those who had been wronged saw their chance at revenge... and so the cycle continues.",
      "nm35aajuha11500_.mp3": "The oppressed become the new generation of oppressors. The human oppressed that is...",
      "nm35aajuha11501_.mp3": "The non-humans were never treated well in any case... We felt the brunt of both administrations...",
      "nm35aajuha11503_.mp3": "Of course it was! They took their frustrations and hates out on us because the people they wanted had already fled or were too well protected!",
      "nm35aajuha11505_.mp3": "What?!? Of course I can! They took their frustrations and hates out on us because the people they wanted had already fled or were too well protected!",
      "nm35aajuha11506_.mp3": "But no one looks out for the injustices we suffered! Oh, no!",
      "nm35aajuha11507_.mp3": "But... I am sorry, I should not have outbursts like that.",
      "nm35aajuha11509_.mp3": "Don't you see? The very fact I mentioned it means it has its influence. Anger can lead to the dark side and I must be ever careful that I do not fall back into those ways.",
      "nm35aajuha11511_.mp3": "I know... And I must be ever careful that I do not fall back into those ways again.",
      "nm35aajuha11513_.mp3": "No, it is not. Anger can lead to the dark side and I must be ever careful that I do not fall back into those ways.",
      "nm35aajuha11514_.mp3": "I... I thank you for your support. My outburst was uncalled for, but you did not lash back at me. You are a much better Jedi than I, it would seem.",
      "nm35aajuha11515_.mp3": "But let us not speak more of this now. We should continue on our journey. Perhaps later we will talk again.",
      "nm35aajuha11517_.mp3": "Yes but humans seem the most pervasive... the most consistent. They took their frustrations and hates out on us because the people they wanted had already fled or were too well protected!",
      "nm35aajuha11519_.mp3": "Of course they left! They had a war to go fight, so that we would not all be killed by those psychotic Mandalorians!",
      "nm35aajuha11521_.mp3": "I can only assume that was some misguided attempt at humor. I was using poetic licence. But those Jedi...",
      "nm35aajuha11523_.mp3": "I was merely using poetic licence. Those Jedi...",
      "nm35aajuha11525_.mp3": "These Jedi were going to fight the Mandalorians just after they had invaded. Many of those Jedi perished in the fighting.",
      "nm35aajuha11528_.mp3": "If you do not wish to hear what I have to say, then find some other being to converse with!",
      "nm35aajuha11530_.mp3": "What?! You...",
      "nm35aajuha11531_.mp3": "Bah! It is useless talking to you it seems! Come back when you are more civilized or when we have something to do.",
      "nm35aajuha11532_.mp3": "Well, I mentioned before that my parents had fled to Taris. Perhaps I can tell you about that.",
      "nm35aajuha11534_.mp3": "In the early days of the Mandalorian war, there had been fighting closer to the Outer Rim worlds.",
      "nm35aajuha11536_.mp3": "Cathar was there, yes. My people had a great reputation as warriors... and that appealed to the Mandalore version of 'honor'.",
      "nm35aajuha11537_.mp3": "They sought to test themselves against us, I think... test themselves by bombing our world, slaughtering my people while they slept or while they ran.",
      "nm35aajuha11539_.mp3": "They swooped down from space across the world, firing at anything that moved. They used ships in space to destroy all orbital facilities and bombard the surface.",
      "nm35aajuha11540_.mp3": "We did resist, and in spite of their violent attack we did stave them off for quite a while.",
      "nm35aajuha11541_.mp3": "But in the end we were doomed...",
      "nm35aajuha11543_.mp3": "We were not members of the Republic. Cathar was beyond the edge of the Republic, in the Outer Rim. And besides, they could not have known.",
      "nm35aajuha11544_.mp3": "Our interstellar communications were the first things the Mandalores hit. All other short-range communicators were jammed... we were on our own.",
      "nm35aajuha11545_.mp3": "We knew what was coming. We had fought the Mandalorians in the first war against Exar Kun and the Sith. We knew there would be no mercy for us.",
      "nm35aajuha11546_.mp3": "The most we could do was pack the few of our people who survived onto what few ships remained and send them off into space as fast as they could.",
      "nm35aajuha11547_.mp3": "Most did not make it.",
      "nm35aajuha11549_.mp3": "My parents carried me as a baby with them and were lucky enough to escape.",
      "nm35aajuha11550_.mp3": "They fled as far as they were able, and eventually settled on Taris. They could stand running no further, I think...",
      "nm35aajuha11551_.mp3": "But Taris was a horrible choice. Dominated by humans, intolerant of other species, it made everyday life unnecessarily hard.",
      "nm35aajuha11553_.mp3": "My father... my father turned to stimulants. He spent much of his time in local bars and dives.",
      "nm35aajuha11554_.mp3": "But we are warriors. It runs through our blood. And when he was on stims he... he... he became foolish... he let his warrior nature get the best of him.",
      "nm35aajuha11555_.mp3": "So he would get intoxicated, and he would fight, and finally one day he would die.",
      "nm35aajuha11557_.mp3": "Killed by a man who provoked him into a fight and killed him like an animal.",
      "nm35aajuha11558_.mp3": "I... I am sorry, I cannot talk about this any longer right now...",
      "nm35aajuha11561_.mp3": "I don't need your sarcasm, or your pity! He died at the hands of another.",
      "nm35aajuha11563_.mp3": "Perhaps they were not. Perhaps they did not know better. It did not take long for things to get worse.",
      "nm35aajuha11565_.mp3": "No, it is not. But they had little choice. Each of us dealt with it in our own way.",
      "nm35aajuha11570_.mp3": "We were prepared! Just not for an invasion of that size... And we had counted on the aid of our allies. Of the Republic...",
      "nm35aajuha11577_.mp3": "No there were not... having fled the birthworld of my species, my parents flew as far and wide as they could.",
      "nm35aajuha11578_.mp3": "And so I was raised alone, knowing of my birthplace only the few stories my parents could tell, and seeing no other member of my species at all...",
      "nm35aajuha11580_.mp3": "It all comes back to wars and fighting... the curse of your race, it seems...",
      "nm35aajuha11582_.mp3": "I have told you my life story already, what more could you possibly want to know? Well... there is one thing...",
      "nm35aajuha11583_.mp3": "I did not want to mention it before, because I was unsure how you would react.",
      "nm35aajuha11585_.mp3": "Do you remember when I told you of the Jedi who had come to my world to fight the Mandalorians?",
      "nm35aajuha11586_.mp3": "They were recruiting soldiers for their crusade against the Mandalores. Many people joined them.",
      "nm35aajuha11588_.mp3": "The main reason for that was their charismatic leader. The one whose troops freed me and let me dream of seeking out and joining the Jedi Order.",
      "nm35aajuha11590_.mp3": "I... I idolized him and the stories they told of him. He was everything I had dreamed a Jedi could be. I still believe he was that way.",
      "nm35aajuha11591_.mp3": "I was hesitant to talk to you about this because... well...",
      "nm35aajuha11593_.mp3": "The Jedi had come to fight the Mandalores under the leadership of a powerful young Jedi... a Jedi named Revan.",
      "nm35aajuha11595_.mp3": "Yes, it was you. I never saw you, else I would have recognized you, but it was your army that freed me from the slavers.",
      "nm35aajuha11596_.mp3": "I cannot express how you have changed my life... or how much you mean to me.",
      "nm35aajuha11597_.mp3": "But I will stay by your side through any trials that may come. Such is the will of the Council... and my own.",
      "nm35aajuha11598_.mp3": "I cannot express how you have changed my life.",
      "nm35aajuha11599_.mp3": "THE Revan. The Jedi who turned to the dark side, became the Dark Lord of the Sith and was defeated by Bastila and her strike team.",
      "nm35aajuha11600_.mp3": "I do not know what happened in the wars with the Mandalorians that turned Revan and Malak, or what they sought with these Star Maps, but the Jedi I knew was a paragon of the Order.",
      "nm35aajuha11601_.mp3": "I am sorry, if this seems wrong to you, but to understand you must realize that Revan was as great as a Jedi could be. Whatever turned Revan must be terrible indeed.",
      "nm35aajuha11602_.mp3": "I wonder if what we find at the end of our journey will turn us as well...",
      "nm35aajuha11604_.mp3": "This is meaningless speculation I guess. I just wanted you to know what I held from you.",
      "nm35aajuha11605_.mp3": "But rest assured that I will not hold back if our enemy is Malak, Revan's apprentice, or indeed even if it was Revan.",
      "nm35aajuha11606_.mp3": "I will help you through all trouble. Such is the will of the Council... And my own.",
      "nm35aajuha11611_.mp3": "Yes... I thought you might react badly... But it was Revan.",
      "nm35aajuha11617_.mp3": "If you do not want to listen, I understand. But hear me out first.",
      "nm35aajuha11619_.mp3": "You... you will see. Perhaps...",
      "nm35aajuha11621_.mp3": "After my father died, my mother was left to support me alone. A single non-human woman, living in one of the worst, most violent slums on Taris.",
      "nm35aajuha11622_.mp3": "It was not easy for her.",
      "nm35aajuha11624_.mp3": "When my father was killed it seemed that something in her began to die as well.",
      "nm35aajuha11625_.mp3": "She worked. She worked as hard as she was able, but over time she began to waste away.",
      "nm35aajuha11626_.mp3": "I later learned that she was unable to get enough money to feed both of us, and had to start borrowing from the Exchange, a band of cutthroats and smugglers. But even that was not enough...",
      "nm35aajuha11627_.mp3": "She hid what she was doing from me. She gave most of her food to me, so that I would be strong. But she herself was suffering deeply from it.",
      "nm35aajuha11628_.mp3": "In the end she could go on no longer, and collapsed at the cantina where she worked one day.",
      "nm35aajuha11630_.mp3": "She never recovered. There was nothing really that I could do for her... She left me no money, and no doctor would see her without being paid first.",
      "nm35aajuha11631_.mp3": "I sat by her bed for days as she lay there dying. I never want that to happen to someone I care about ever again...",
      "nm35aajuha11632_.mp3": "But there was still the money she had borrowed... She had never paid it back, and made no provisions for her death.",
      "nm35aajuha11633_.mp3": "You must understand: the Exchange is brutal. They care nothing for the life of a sentient being. They are the major suppliers of slaves on Taris.",
      "nm35aajuha11635_.mp3": "They thought it was appropriate that, with my mother owing them money, the debt should be passed on to me. And with no way to pay, they took me by force.",
      "nm35aajuha11636_.mp3": "You have no idea what it is like to be bound like a beast and treated as such. It was the worst time of my life.",
      "nm35aajuha11637_.mp3": "They treated me like livestock. They were waiting for a buyer to give them some credits for me when the Jedi came to fight the Mandalorians.",
      "nm35aajuha11639_.mp3": "The Jedi could not abide by what they saw there, and drove the Exchange from the face of the world, freeing those of us imprisoned there.",
      "nm35aajuha11640_.mp3": "But the Jedi soon left to fight their war. And I was left with a dream...",
      "nm35aajuha11642_.mp3": "I swore that I would become a Jedi. As soon as I had enough money to do it, I bought passage on a freighter headed for Dantooine.",
      "nm35aajuha11643_.mp3": "And we both know what has happened since then.",
      "nm35aajuha11645_.mp3": "I am grateful to you for having given me the opportunity to fulfill my dream, rather than become what I hated.",
      "nm35aajuha11646_.mp3": "Someday I may make it up to you, but for now, let us keep on the task at hand.",
      "nm35aajuha11659_.mp3": "I... I thank you for your concern, but I am still a bit shaken.",
      "nm35aajuha11661_.mp3": "I have been thinking about myself... about Quatra... and about my fall to the dark side.",
      "nm35aajuha11662_.mp3": "I keep thinking that it was my anger that drove me that far, that nearly damned me. I look inside myself now and I can still see it, I still feel it.",
      "nm35aajuha11664_.mp3": "I think maybe, that I just need more time.",
      "nm35aajuha11666_.mp3": "Would you rather I fell again and attacked? Slaughtered you in your sleep like an animal?",
      "nm35aajuha11667_.mp3": "I see in your pride you do not think that possible.",
      "nm35aajuha11668_.mp3": "Very well, then! Keep your own counsel.",
      "nm35aajuha11670_.mp3": "More time would do me good. Time to distance myself from that anger.",
      "nm35aajuha11671_.mp3": "I think that is why the Council agreed to send me with you. They think, perhaps, that in your company I will be able to free myself from it.",
      "nm35aajuha11674_.mp3": "I thank you for your concern and your acceptance. I will strive to prove that I am worthy of your company and trust.",
      "nm35aajuha11676_.mp3": "I do not come here begging for scraps from you! I will earn my way with you. You will see just how valuable I am!",
      "nm35aajuha11678_.mp3": "I am. I try to be strong, as one of my people should, but I know I am still weak inside.",
      "nm35aajuha11679_.mp3": "I have been doing well, I suppose. As well as I can. But I am more interested in you right now.",
      "nm35aajuha11680_.mp3": "Do not mistake me, it is just that even though we have traveled together for a while, it seems I know next to nothing about you, personally.",
      "nm35aajuha11682_.mp3": "Please, forgive me... I did not mean to insinuate that I... that we...",
      "nm35aajuha11683_.mp3": "It did not come out the way I had intended.",
      "nm35aajuha11684_.mp3": "We have been travelling together since Dantooine, but I know nothing of you before that. Would you... would you humor me and tell me a little about yourself?",
      "nm35aajuha11686_.mp3": "Your job? Your childhood? Your life?",
      "nm35aajuha11687_.mp3": "Your... family?",
      "nm35aajuha11688_.mp3": "I am sorry if I am making you uncomfortable. I will fully understand if you choose not to answer.",
      "nm35aajuha11690_.mp3": "I greatly appreciate your taking the time to talk to me. How did you come to be on Dantooine?",
      "nm35aajuha11691_.mp3": "Besides the obvious, of course.",
      "nm35aajuha11693_.mp3": "Taris... It always seems to come back to Taris for me...",
      "nm35aajuha11694_.mp3": "I am sorry... I get distracted. I already know the tales of your exploits: how you defeated the Mandalorians in the war... and how you fell.",
      "nm35aajuha11695_.mp3": "But now you have the chance to redeem yourself. To make a new page in your history.",
      "nm35aajuha11696_.mp3": "So now, I suppose, that all does not matter. Only your life now does.",
      "nm35aajuha11697_.mp3": "I am sorry... I get distracted. What did you do before Ta... before that?",
      "nm35aajuha11699_.mp3": "A life in the army. Not my career of choice, though. We Cathar cannot seem to adjust to regimented organizations like the military.",
      "nm35aajuha11700_.mp3": "But in a way it does seem to have it's own romantic appeal. Defending the galaxy from evil.",
      "nm35aajuha11701_.mp3": "Much as we Jedi do. So in a way, I suppose, we are more alike than not.",
      "nm35aajuha11702_.mp3": "But again I seem to be wasting your time with my carrying on. I apologize.",
      "nm35aajuha11703_.mp3": "But I have heard that it appeals to males of your species. Fighting, defending.",
      "nm35aajuha11704_.mp3": "That is what we as Jedi seem to be called upon to do. Perhaps we are not as unalike as I had previously thought...",
      "nm35aajuha11709_.mp3": "Heh. Yes, I kind of figured that. From where? Oh wait... I remember...",
      "nm35aajuha11711_.mp3": "I understand. I appreciate that you take the time to talk to me. I will be more considerate of your time in the future.",
      "nm35aajuha11714_.mp3": "Hah. Humility. Please, if you would, indulge me.",
      "nm35aajuha11716_.mp3": "Your humility is... astounding as always. So what can you tell me?",
      "nm35aajuha11719_.mp3": "Oh. I see. It is because you wish to keep me at arm's length.",
      "nm35aajuha11720_.mp3": "Are you worried about me turning to the dark side? Or do you merely not wish my company.",
      "nm35aajuha11721_.mp3": "Whatever the case, I am sorry for presuming too much. I will remember my station from now on.",
      "nm35aajuha11723_.mp3": "Yes. Yes, I do. I more than most perhaps. But I do not know the stories of your past. Legends rarely are laid bare like that.",
      "nm35aajuha11725_.mp3": "I have been thinking much about our journey, and I am grateful and honored that you have accepted me with you.",
      "nm35aajuha11726_.mp3": "It is an honor to be by your side and to see you redeemed from the dark path you had chosen before.",
      "nm35aajuha11727_.mp3": "I am not used to such unbiased acceptance from one who is nearly a stranger to me.",
      "nm35aajuha11728_.mp3": "We Cathar do not make friends easily, or for long. Even on Dantooine, I remained alone. Not ostracized exactly, but... separate.",
      "nm35aajuha11730_.mp3": "In truth, I have lived in the Republic too long, and know little. I never met any others of my race other than my parents. But we are not diplomats. We do not deal well with groups. This situation is new to me.",
      "nm35aajuha11732_.mp3": "Yes, it was. I find it difficult to speak of those things. I do not want to live that way ever again. And here it seems different...",
      "nm35aajuha11734_.mp3": "Well, even if we do not speak that often, or are apart, I still feel a part of a team; this group you have assembled that accompanies you and Bastila on your quest.",
      "nm35aajuha11735_.mp3": "It is... warming. I feel almost welcome. Needed.",
      "nm35aajuha11736_.mp3": "You seem to be very decisive when it is required of you. It is reassuring to know that I can count on someone like you.",
      "nm35aajuha11738_.mp3": "What? But... I thought...",
      "nm35aajuha11739_.mp3": "It seems I was mistaken... I should have known things could not change for me that easily.",
      "nm35aajuha11740_.mp3": "As it is the Council's wishes, I will accompany you. I will do my duty, and trust that you will do yours.",
      "nm35aajuha11742_.mp3": "To be accepted so readily... I find it difficult to explain. It is so different from what I am used to.",
      "nm35aajuha11744_.mp3": "Yes... and that is my point. I find it difficult to explain. It is so different from what I am used to.",
      "nm35aajuha11745_.mp3": "Just... Thank you for accepting me.",
      "nm35aajuha11747_.mp3": "I feel that I could count on any of you. But you... you are the one who drew me back from the dark side. It is to you that I feel a debt.",
      "nm35aajuha11748_.mp3": "And I SHALL make it up to you.",
      "nm35aajuha11750_.mp3": "Wha...",
      "nm35aajuha11751_.mp3": "Taris was my home for many years. As much as I hated it, it was still home.",
      "nm35aajuha11752_.mp3": "A rat-hole; a warren; a paradise. I suppose you could call it all these things.",
      "nm35aajuha11753_.mp3": "For me it was hell...",

      "nm35aajuha11757_.mp3": "But it was precisely the people who made it so bad!",
      "nm35aajuha11759_.mp3": "To walk down the streets. To have people look at you in disgust; like an animal. Most did not know anything about me, but it was there all the same.",
      "nm35aajuha11760_.mp3": "Because I was an 'alien'. Because I was different from them; frightening.",
      "nm35aajuha11761_.mp3": "I doubt any of them had even seen my people before. So they persecuted me...",
      "nm35aajuha11762_.mp3": "They looked down on me and my family. Charged us more for food. Would not let us walk their streets. They spat on us.",
      "nm35aajuha11763_.mp3": "You are human... you could not possibly know.",
      "nm35aajuha11765_.mp3": "That is true I suppose. But it much more obvious for someone like me.",
      "nm35aajuha11766_.mp3": "There were no other Cathar on Taris. No one to talk to. No one to confide in.",
      "nm35aajuha11767_.mp3": "Humph! But you must think me weak for saying this. But I am strong enough to admit it!",
      "nm35aajuha11769_.mp3": "I thank you for your concern, but...",
      "nm35aajuha11771_.mp3": "I... I do not know. I have been keeping it inside for so long. I thought you might understand. You do not seem to fit in exactly with the others. You are... different.",
      "nm35aajuha11772_.mp3": "Bah! Maybe I am weak. To think that some stories of my stupid past could possibly interest you.",
      "nm35aajuha11774_.mp3": "I thank you. You are kinder than I would have expected... To put up with me using you in this way.",
      "nm35aajuha11775_.mp3": "I hope that I will not use your time so badly in the future. Thank you.",
      "nm35aajuha11777_.mp3": "Maybe there is no point. Maybe I am just lost after leaving yet another planet. I apologize for my outburst. I will try to control myself next time.",
      "nm35aajuha11781_.mp3": "How can you say that? You have seen Taris, you know what kind of a scum infested hole it is.",
      "nm35aajuha11782_.mp3": "For us there was no respite. No one to turn to.",
      "nm35aajuha11784_.mp3": "What? You.. You are just like them!",
      "nm35aajuha11785_.mp3": "I would not have thought you were so cruel as that.",
      "nm35aajuha11786_.mp3": "It seems I was mistaken... I should have known things could not change for me that easily.",
      "nm35aajuha11787_.mp3": "As it is the Council's wishes, I will accompany you. I will do my duty, and trust that you will do yours.",
      "nm35aajuha11789_.mp3": "I am wary of the Mandalorian. I do not trust him.",
      "nm35aajuha11793_.mp3": "I have never trusted Mandalorians. They drove my parents from Cathar, aided the Sith and attacked the Republic. Their warped notions of 'honor' may provoke them to do even more heinous acts.",
      "nm35aajuha11794_.mp3": "I do not know why you tolerate his presence on your ship. In truth, he has had some merit so far, but I am not certain it is worth the risk you take.",
      "nm35aajuha11798_.mp3": "Eliminate? What? I never proposed to murder the man!",
      "nm35aajuha11799_.mp3": "His kind may prove to be a danger to the galaxy again, but this man himself has proven acceptable so far. Merely keep your distance from him and watch him, so that he does not betray us.",
      "nm35aajuha11801_.mp3": "Spoken to him? No! No, I could not.",
      "nm35aajuha11802_.mp3": "Mandalorians are vicious of temper and easily provoked. I... I would not want to tempt his wrath.",
      "nm35aajuha11805_.mp3": "I am sorry. It is just that I cannot stand to be around him for very long. I suppose I do not really dislike him, it is just...",
      "nm35aajuha11807_.mp3": "The Mandalorians came and overran my world, they slaughtered my race... I cannot forget what they have done. Or forgive.",
      "nm35aajuha11809_.mp3": "You are right, of course. You always seem to know what you speak of.",
      "nm35aajuha11811_.mp3": "Maybe. Maybe not. I cannot forgive them for what they have done to me and my people.",
      "nm35aajuha11812_.mp3": "In time Canderous may prove himself. But it will not be easy.",
      "nm35aajuha11814_.mp3": "I can take care of myself! I do not need you to patronize me!",
      "nm35aajuha11815_.mp3": "But... I thank you for your kind words. It is hard being alone all the time. To be accepted and welcomed is... flattering.",
      "nm35aajuha11816_.mp3": "But it is gratifying to know that you value me as a companion that much.",
      "nm35aajuha11817_.mp3": "This simmering anger and hatred for the Mandalores seems to have found a place in my heart, though. Sometimes, I worry...",
      "nm35aajuha11819_.mp3": "That I may fall to the dark side once again. That I may threaten you, the Republic... the entire galaxy.",
      "nm35aajuha11820_.mp3": "If... If that time does come. And if i do threaten our task. It is only right that you should strike me down.",
      "nm35aajuha11822_.mp3": "But still it eats away at me. I worry that I may yet again fall and endanger everything that I hold dear.",
      "nm35aajuha11824_.mp3": "Should that time come again, I would rather no one else do it than the one who redeemed me in the first place.",
      "nm35aajuha11825_.mp3": "If I fall and endanger you and the galaxy you must do what is right. If my death will defeat Malak, then that is what must be done.",
      "nm35aajuha11826_.mp3": "But we are becoming too morbid too soon. We should not talk like this now. There is much yet we can do.",
      "nm35aajuha11827_.mp3": "But we shall talk later I am sure.",
      "nm35aajuha11831_.mp3": "I am not a coward! I fear no one and nothing! But you have not had to flee the destruction of your homeworld either, human.",
      "nm35aajuha11833_.mp3": "Speak to him? No, no!",
      "nm35aajuha11835_.mp3": "I am not paranoid! My suspicions are justified. I dare not speak about it around him, though.",
      "nm35aajuha11837_.mp3": "That is true. But also I know his kind. This man he may be different, but...",
      "nm35aajuha11839_.mp3": "I am not! They are not to be trusted! They are brutes and savages and destroyers of worlds!",
      "nm35aajuha11841_.mp3": "Of course. If there is anything else, I am here to help.",
      "nm35aajuha11842_.mp3": "I do not know how to help you with that, I am sorry.",
      "nm35aajuha11843_.mp3": "I do not have the answer to your question.",
      "nm36aadakv01003_.mp3": "Dak? That is you, isn't it? I... hardly recognized you.",

      "nm36aadakv01010_.mp3": "Running away? Again?",
      "nm36aadakv01014_.mp3": "I don't think there's much to talk about.",

      "nm39aastar99006_.mp3": "The Sith have long worshipped the ancient secrets of the dark side. It is not surprising to find the Star Map in a place like this.",

      "nm40aacart05066_.mp3": "You speak the truth. I alone of all the group might be able to remain hidden if the Sith search the ship.",
      "nm40aacart05068_.mp3": "I could wait until the guards have completed their search, then come to rescue you.",
      "nm40aacart05070_.mp3": "I think you may be underestimating my abilities, but I will bow to your decision.",
      "nm40adcart01000_.mp3": "Where is Bastila? What happened on the ship?",
      "nm40adcart01053_.mp3": "It was Saul Karath who commanded the fleet that attacked your people, Carth. And it was Malak who gave the order. You know this.",
      "nm40adcart01054_.mp3": "I have felt the presence of the dark side in you, Revan - as it is in all of us. I know the dangers of that path; yet I also know the fallen can be redeemed.",
      "nm40adcart01055_.mp3": "I judge you by your actions, and as long as we have been together I have seen you act as a servant of the light.",
      "nm40adcart01111_.mp3": "I have seen signs of the taint of the dark side in your actions and deeds, but I will not give up on you as you did not give up on me. I will stay with you, Revan.",
      "nm40adcart01112_.mp3": "I can tell there is conflict between light and darkness within you. I do not know which way the struggle will turn, but I will not abandon you in this difficult time, as you did not abandon me.",
      "nm40adcart01122_.mp3": "The Dark Lord will not kill her. He will want to use her battle meditation ability against the Republic. He will take her alive so he can turn her to the dark side. I am sure of it.",
      "nm41aablac01019_.mp3": "You understand these aliens? Of course... you must have come here and learned their languge in your search for the secrets of the Star Forge. Back when you were still Revan.",
      "nm41aacart03012_.mp3": "I don't know what fate awaits us, but I sense Bastila still has a role to play in the events to come. I have no doubt she will be waiting for us on the Star Forge.",
      "nm41aacart03015_.mp3": "Bastila tried to tempt her to the dark side, to reclaim Revan's heritage. She failed.",
      "nm41aacart03040_.mp3": "Confidence is all well and good, Carth, but if we are going to catch up to Bastila we should leave soon, don't you think?",
      "nm41aacart03053_.mp3": "She is not dead, Carth - though maybe that might have been easier for you to accept. She has fallen to the dark side and fled to the Star Forge.",
      "nm41aacart03113_.mp3": "During our rather rapid descent I noticed the hulls of many crashed ships scattered across the landscape. Perhaps the parts you need can be found among their wreckage.",
      "nm41aacart03124_.mp3": "I only hope we're not too late. Bastila has been Malak's prisoner for a long time. If he can turn her to the dark side she will join him and the Sith will be invincible.",
      "nm41adguid01005_.mp3": "We have had a... a premonition. The Force has given us a vision. There is great danger within the Temple. We cannot let you face it alone.",
      "nm41adguid01010_.mp3": "Jolee speaks for both of us. You must enter the Temple, but we must go with you.",
      "nm44acevil01002_.mp3": "Quickly, Bastila - come with us! We have to escape before Malak arrives!",
      "nm44acevil01048_.mp3": "Bastila, it is not too late for you to be saved. The teachings of the Jedi can lead you from the dark side back into the light and a true understanding of the Force. ",
      "nm44acevil01060_.mp3": "A true Jedi will never bow down to the Sith. If this is your decision I have no choice but to do battle against you.",
      "nm44acevil01069_.mp3": "No! Do not walk down this path... it can only lead to destruction! I know of what I speak!",
      "nm44acevil01071_.mp3": "I have no wish to fight you and Bastila, but if you choose to walk down this path you know I must stand against you... even at the cost of my life.",
      "nm44acevil01083_.mp3": "No! This is the way of the dark side! Do not give in to the anger and hatred!"

      "nm02aebend03003_.mp3": "But I only fight in death matches, and not too many people are willing to step into the ring knowing they won't ever come out. How 'bout you, Stranger? You think you got what it takes?",
      "nm02aebend03004_.mp3": "Back again? You're starting to bore me. I don't come here to talk - I come to watch the duels and see if there's anyone worthy of stepping into the ring with me.",
      "nm02aebend03006_.mp3": "Sorry, I don't waste my time with no-names. You have to prove yourself before you get a shot at me. I'm the real deal, kid - 100 death matches without a loss!",

      "nm02aebend03021_.mp3": "Hmmm... never figured you for a coward. You ever get the guts to fight me come on back and we can set the match up. Otherwise we've got nothing to talk about.",
      "nm02aebend03024_.mp3": "Finally - fresh meat! Ajuur will set it all up; go talk to him. It will take some time to arrange, so no point sticking around here until then. I'll be back when it's time for you to die!",
      "nm02aebend03026_.mp3": "If you can prove yourself in the ring by beating all these other so-called duelists, I'll agree to face you in a death match. You win, you get to collect that bounty for killing me.",

      "nm02aebend03037_.mp3": "People are always bugging me for my autoprint. Comes with the territory. You survive over 100 death matches and people tend to see you as something of a legend.",
      "nm02aebend03038_.mp3": "What, you don't recognize me? I'm Bendak Starkiller, the most famous blaster-slinger on Taris. Over 100 duels without a loss - every one of them a death match!",
      "nm02aebend03041_.mp3": "I'm retired now. Once death matches became illegal I just got bored with the game. I've got no interest in using stun blasters! There was nobody left to challenge me, anyway.",

      "nm45aadark99004_.mp3": "Revan is on the Star Forge, looking to reclaim the title of Dark Lord of the Sith. Wait here for my old master. Whichever one of you deals the killing blow to Revan will become my new apprentice.",

      "nm45aadart04001_.mp3": "You made a mistake coming here, Revan. The Star Forge fuels my command of the dark side. You are no match for me here. And this time you will not escape!",
      "nm45aadart04003_.mp3": "Is that what you call it? You think stripping away your power and your identity was an act of mercy, Revan? I would rather die!",
      "nm45aadart04005_.mp3": "Spoken like a true slave of the Jedi code. Save your preaching, Revan - I will have none of it!",
      "nm45aadart04008_.mp3": "Ha-ha! You are such a fool, Revan! You claim to be a Jedi, yet you feed on anger and hate! But even the power of the dark side cannot save you now!",
      "nm45aadart04009_.mp3": "You are an insignificant speck beneath my notice. I have surpassed you in every way and accomplished what you never could... I have unleashed the full potential of this Rakatan factory!",
      "nm45aadart04010_.mp3": "You had no idea of the power within this place! Its very walls are alive with dark side energies! And now, my old master, I will let the Star Forge itself destroy you!",
      "nm45aadart04012_.mp3": "You may have reclaimed your identity, Revan, but you have lost the power you once wielded! You are not the Dark Lord anymore. You are nothing!",

      "nm45aadart04016_.mp3": "Yes... I cannot deny it any longer. [cough] You are the one who deserves... who deserves to be the Dark Lord.",
      "nm45aadart04017_.mp3": "You were the one who found the first Star Map on Dantooine, Revan. [cough] It was you who lead us on our quest for the Star Forge. I only followed in your wake.",

      "nm45aadart04025_.mp3": "Still... [cough] still spouting the wisdom the Jedi, I see. Maybe there is more truth in their code than I ever believed.",
      "nm45aadart04026_.mp3": "I... I cannot help but wonder, Revan. What would have happened had our positions been reversed? What if fate had decreed I would be captured by the Jedi?",
      "nm45aadart04027_.mp3": "Could I have returned to the light, as you did? [cough] If you had not led me down the dark path in the first place, what destiny would I have found?",
      "nm45aadart04029_.mp3": "I suppose... I suppose you speak the truth. I alone must accept responsibility for my fate. I wanted to be Master of the Sith and ruler of the galaxy.",
      "nm45aadart04030_.mp3": "But that destiny was not mine, Revan. [cough] It might have been yours, perhaps... but never mine. And in the end, as the darkness takes me, I am nothing.",
      "nm45aadart04033_.mp3": "You continue to amaze me, Revan. If only you had been the one to uncover the true power of the Star Forge you might have become truly invincible.",
      "nm45aadart04034_.mp3": "But you were a fool. All you saw was an enormous factory, all you ever imagined was an infinite fleet rolling forth to crush the Republic. You were blind, Revan - blind and stupid!",
      "nm45aadart04036_.mp3": "The Star Forge is more than just a space station. In some ways, it is like a living creature. It hungers. And it can feed on the dark side that is within all of us!",
      "nm45aadart04037_.mp3": "Look around you, Revan. See the bodies? You should recognize them from the Academy. These are Jedi who fell when I attacked Dantooine. For all intents and purposes dead, except for one difference:",
      "nm45aadart04038_.mp3": "I have not let them become one with the Force. Instead I have brought them here. The Star Forge corrupts what remains of their power and transfers the dark taint to me!",
      "nm45aadart04040_.mp3": "You cannot beat me, Revan. Not here on the Star Forge. Not when I can draw upon the power of all these Jedi!",
      "nm45aadart04041_.mp3": "And once you are beaten I will do the same to you. You will be trapped in a terrible existence between life and death, your power feeding me as I conquer the galaxy!",
      "nm45aadart04043_.mp3": "Well done, Revan. I was certain the defenses of the Star Forge would destroy you, but I see there is more of your old self in you than I expected.",
      "nm45aadart04044_.mp3": "You are stronger than I thought; stronger than you ever were during your reign as the Dark Lord. I did not think that was possible.",
      "nm45aadart04046_.mp3": "I am tempted to try and capture you alive, Revan. Then I could break your will and bind you to me as my apprentice, as I did Bastila.",
      "nm45aadart04047_.mp3": "You would be a far greater asset to me than even Bastila and her Battle Meditation, if I could control you. But is it worth the risk?",
      "nm45aadart04048_.mp3": "Perhaps you are too powerful to be my apprentice. I betrayed you when I realized my own strength was greater than yours; in time you might try to do the same to me.",
      "nm45aadart04050_.mp3": "Foolish words. The darkness and the light wage a constant war within you. The balance is tipped one way now, but it can easily be tipped back.",
      "nm45aadart04051_.mp3": "Savior, conqueror, hero, villain. You are all things Revan... and yet you are nothing. In the end you belong to neither the light nor the darkness. You will forever stand alone.",
      "nm45aadart04053_.mp3": "Of course. What else do you have? Fate and destiny have conspired to keep you alive despite my best efforts; they have thrust you into the role of savior. ",
      "nm45aadart04056_.mp3": "Once you were stronger than me, Revan. But as your apprentice I surpassed you. The Master must always be stronger than the apprentice... that was why I betrayed you.",
      "nm45aadart04058_.mp3": "No! I was prepared to face you, Revan. But fate presented me with a better option. I saw my opportunity and seized it.",
      "nm45aadart04059_.mp3": "The trap set by the Jedi only hastened my decision. If they had not attacked I would have challenged you for mastery of the Sith soon enough.",
      "nm45aadart04063_.mp3": "I cannot deny your resilience. You survived my first betrayal, thanks to Bastila's inteference. You escaped the destruction of Taris and you escaped me on the Leviathan.",
      "nm45aadart04064_.mp3": "You even survived my attempt to destroy you with the Star Forge itself. Fate and destiny have conspired to keep you alive despite all my efforts.",
      "nm45aadart04065_.mp3": "We have been inexorably pushed to this final confrontation, Revan. I see now that this can only be settled when one of us destroys the other.",
      "nm45aadart04067_.mp3": "No, Revan, this time our confrontation can only end in death... yours or mine.",
      "nm45aadart04068_.mp3": "Once again we shall face each other in single combat... and the victor will decide the fate of the galaxy!",
      "nm45aadart04070_.mp3": "You are eager for blood, Revan... as am I. Very well, you shall have your wish.",
      "nm45aaligh01001_.mp3": "This will not take long, Bastila. You will be able to resume your Battle Meditation soon enough. I only wanted you to know that Revan is here on the Star Forge.",
      "nm45aaligh01003_.mp3": "The Force is bringing us towards a confrontation with my old master. The Star Forge has drawn our enemies together so they may all die in a single, glorious day!",
      "nm45aaligh01004_.mp3": "You must kill Revan to prove yourself worthy of being my apprentice, Bastila. You must finish what began in the Rakatan Temple.",
      "nm45aaligh01006_.mp3": "I sense your fear, Bastila. But it is unfounded. The power of the Star Forge will feed the dark side within you, it will give you the strength you need to defeat my old master.",
      "nm45aaligh01007_.mp3": "Stay here in the command center while you use your Battle Meditation against the Republic fleet. Revan will find you here in due time. It is inevitable.",
      "nm45aaligh01009_.mp3": "Perhaps you will triumph, Bastila. But even if you fail it will give me the time I need to complete my preparations of the station's defenses.",

      "nm45aaligh010xx_.mp3": "Ha-ha-ha!",
      "nm45aamalak1001_.mp3": "This is not unexpected. The Jedi are formidable opponents. Send the Star Forge's battle droids to deal with them.",
      "nm45aamalak1003_.mp3": "You underestimate the power of the Star Forge's droid army. Dispatch the droids.",
      "nm45aamalak2000_.mp3": "Why have you disturbed me?",
      "nm45aamalak2002_.mp3": "Ah, the Jedi. Did my droids pass their test? Did they destroy our enemies?",
      "nm45aamalak2004_.mp3": "Strange. I did not think there were any among the Order who could survive an attack by an army of the Star Forge's battle droids.",
      "nm45aamalak2006_.mp3": "Yes... that would explain why the droids failed. Revan always was strong in the Force. Very well - send out all available troops. The apprentices, as well.",
      "nm45aamalak2008_.mp3": "Of course not! But they will slow Revan down. That will give me the time I need to fully prepare the Star Forge's defenses.",
      "nm45aamalak2009_.mp3": "I am curious to see the true extent of this space station's capabilities. One as powerful as my old master will make an interesting test subject.",

      "nm17ae04ni04004_.mp3": "Don't know how much longer I'll be around here, but maybe we'll have time for a few races.",

      "nm17ae04ni04016_.mp3": "It's not that I'm not grateful. I mean, it would get me into the pros. I don't have the credits to get in on my own.",
      "nm17ae04ni04017_.mp3": "Not that I care about credits. I just want to race... but the deal with Motta is pretty bad. He'll get most of what I win.",

      "nm17ae04ni04031_.mp3": "It doesn't matter what you think. You don't really know anything about it. Only a top racer would.",
      "nm17ae04ni04032_.mp3": "No offense, but you aren't on the boards compared to me. Post some stunners, then we'll talk.",
      "nm17ae04ni04034_.mp3": "[Success] I... I'll sign the contract. Yeah, I guess that's best. I mean, the deal can't be all bad, right?",
      "nm17ae04ni04035_.mp3": "I mean, you'd know, right? And all I want is to race. Who cares about the credits... who cares.",
      "nm17ae04ni04036_.mp3": "Thanks for... making things clear. If you don't mind, I think we're done. Goodbye.",
      "nm17ae04ni04038_.mp3": "[Failure] Uh, no. Not until I've given it some thought. What, did you think I would just cave in?",
      "nm17ae04ni04039_.mp3": "Now, if you don't mind, I think we're done for now.",
      "nm17ae04ni04041_.mp3": "Don't threaten me. Every racer here will step up to stop you. You aren't one of us. We take care of our own.",
      "nm17ae04ni04042_.mp3": "Heh, maybe Motta isn't so sure of himself if he has threaten me. Are we done now? I've thinking to do.",
      "nm17ae04ni04045_.mp3": "I doubt there's much you could say. It's not your business anyway. Top racers take care of their own.",
      "nm17ae04ni04046_.mp3": "Thanks anyway, but I'll think it through myself.",
      "nm17ae04ni04047_.mp3": "You've posted some good times... he might listen to you. I would. I respect you as a racer.",
      "nm17ae04ni04048_.mp3": "But... I kind of doubt he'd give me a better deal. He doesn't have to. He is putting up most of the money.",

      "nm17ae04ni04059_.mp3": "If there's anything around, it'll be at the Czerka store in their office in the center of town. Stock is scarce on this rock.",
      "nm17ae04ni04061_.mp3": "Motta has some basic incentives for good times, which you probably know, but this is just an amateur track.",
      "nm17ae04ni04062_.mp3": "The pro circuit is where the real credits are, but even that is hurting. I guess a lot of riders were on Taris.",
      "nm17ae04ni04064_.mp3": "Hurry it up, all right? I have things on my mind.",
      "nm17ae04ni04066_.mp3": "Sorry. I've been here a few years, but only for the racing. Maybe ask over at Fazza's club. The hunters get around.",
      "nm17ae04ni04068_.mp3": "All right. See you around the track.",
      "nm17ae04ni04069_.mp3": "Nice job beating my times, too. I guess my heart isn't in the racing. Contracts are distracting stuff.",
      "nm17ae04ni04070_.mp3": "Go on, leave me alone. I've got stuff to worry about.",
      "nm17ae04ni04072_.mp3": "Racer stuff. Nothing you'd understand. Don't mean to be rude, but it's kind of secret.",
      "nm17ae04ni04074_.mp3": "Ha! Sure! Race your bike out of that explosion? Everyone knows that the whole planet is gone. Nobody got out.",
      "nm17ae04ni04075_.mp3": "I'm not in the mood for jokes, thanks. I've got things to think about. You wouldn't know anything about it.",
      "nm17ae04ni04076_.mp3": "You race, right? Know anything about contracts? Ah, I shouldn't get into it. It's my problem.",
      "nm17ae04ni04077_.mp3": "Deal with that Hutt Motta and you'll understand. Until then, I just don't want to talk about it.",
      "nm17ae04ni04079_.mp3": "I don't feel like answering. I wouldn't be much help to you anyway. I just race. Don't know about anything else.",

      "nm36aadakv01004_.mp3": "It's been a long time, Juhani.",
      "nm36aadakv01006_.mp3": "I didn't 'fall', Juhani... I had my eyes opened. And don't look at me like that. Last I recall, you were having your own doubts.",

      "nm36aadakv01008_.mp3": "Save it. The Jedi aren't for me... not anymore. Look... I'm not going to ask why a couple of Jedi are in the Valley of the Dark Lords.",
      "nm36aadakv01009_.mp3": " I don't want to know. It's better that I don't. In fact, I'll just get out of here and leave you to whatever it is you're planning to do. Fair enough?",
      "nm36aadakv01011_.mp3": "Why not? It's what I do best.",
      "nm36aadakv01013_.mp3": "Yes. Isn't it obvious? I don't want to talk about it here, however.",
      "nm36aadakv01015_.mp3": "Have it your way, Juhani. You always do.",
      "nm36aadakv01017_.mp3": "Does it matter? I'm going. Isn't that enough for you?",
      "nm36aadakv01020_.mp3": "Look... I don't want to be here after you leave. There'll be too many questions. So ask what you have to ask and I'll be on my way.",
      "nm36aadakv01021_.mp3": "Master Uthar won't allow us to dig with lasers or sonics... we have to use hand tools only so we don't accidentally destroy anything we run across. That makes progress very slow, however.",
      "nm36aadakv01023_.mp3": "Well... it seems that the Sith once inhabited Korriban a long time ago. There was a fortress here that was destroyed at some point before the Sith abandoned the planet completely.",
      "nm36aadakv01024_.mp3": "Why they left, we don't know. Perhaps the Jedi drove them off. The tombs in this valley are the only parts of the fortress we've found mostly intact.",
      "nm36aadakv01026_.mp3": "Some. Most of the interesting stuff is still in the tombs, but Master Uthar prefers to leave them to be explored by the students, as a challenge.",
      "nm36aadakv01027_.mp3": "In time, they will probably become safe enough for us to enter. Until that time, however, we're stuck to digging up the valley piece by piece.",
      "nm36aadakv01029_.mp3": "Definitely dangerous. Most of the students that go inside them don't come back out. Master Uthar prefers it that way.",
      "nm36aadakv01031_.mp3": "There's four tombs here. On the right are the tombs of Ajunta Pall and Tulak Hord. On the left are the tombs of Marka Ragnos and Naga Sadow. All four were ancient Sith Lords.",
      "nm36aadakv01033_.mp3": "That's the first tomb on the right. There's a rumor that there's a powerful artifact still in there, but nobody's retrieved it, yet.",
      "nm36aadakv01034_.mp3": "That tomb supposedly has ancient battle droids and traps that are still functioning. It's amazing that their power sources have lasted so long, really.",
      "nm36aadakv01036_.mp3": "That's the farthest tomb on the right. We don't know much about Tulak Hord, unfortunately... the tuk'ata have a nest in that tomb, I think.",
      "nm36aadakv01038_.mp3": "A local pack animal that's very dangerous. Occasionally the guards track down a queen and kill it... that usually pacifies them for a bit.",
      "nm36aadakv01040_.mp3": "That's the first tomb on the left. Someone mentioned that a crazy droid has holed itself up in there, but I don't know much about that.",
      "nm36aadakv01043_.mp3": "Nothing that I can think of. There's supposedly some old Sith hermit that haunts these hills and kidnaps students. Might want to watch out for him.",
      "nm36aadakv01045_.mp3": "A Star Map? No, I haven't heard anything about that. Something like that could be in Naga Sadow's tomb, I suppose... that tomb's off limits to the students.",
      "nm36aadakv01047_.mp3": "It's the second tomb on the left when you enter the valley. Naga Sadow was the leader of the old Sith Masters here, we think.",
      "nm36aadakv01048_.mp3": "Darth Malak found something in there a while back, however, and ever since then only Master Uthar can enter it.",
      "nm36aadakv01050_.mp3": "No. A lot of the discoveries are kept secret, even from the students. I only heard that Darth Malak found something there by rumor, to be honest.",
      "nm36aadakv01052_.mp3": "So do I.",
      "nm36aadakv01054_.mp3": "Goodbye, Juhani.",
      "nm36aadakv01055_.mp3": "Alright. Just be careful if you head into any of those tombs.",

      "nm17aggrif03031_.mp3": "Come on, I'm Mission's brother! I'm her family! I mean, think what she'll do if you just let the Exchange kill me! Besides, this is a sweet deal!",
      "nm17aggrif03034_.mp3": "Sorry, like I said before I don't have any credits on me. And Greeta won't lend me any credits. I mean, it's like he doesn't trust me to pay him back or something.",
      "nm17aggrif03036_.mp3": "But you come through on this and I promise you'll get a huge payday down the road. Two... no! Three thousand credits! How's that sound?",
      "nm17aggrif03041_.mp3": "Mission didn't come with you, I see. Uh... guess she's still mad at me. Oh well... it's probably for the best. This job is more up your alley anyway.",
      "nm17aggrif03042_.mp3": "You're back! I knew you'd come through for me. I knew I could count on you! Uh... you do have a tach gland for me, right?",
      "nm17aggrif03044_.mp3": "Come to papa you sweet simian organ! It may not look like much, but once I turn this into a bottle of Tarisian ale it'll end up being worth a fortune!",
      "nm17aggrif03046_.mp3": "Thanks, Mission. You won't regret helping me out with this!",
      "nm17aggrif03050_.mp3": "Geez, sis - that's pretty harsh. Come on, I know things haven't been great between us but when I corner the market on Tarisian ale I'll make things up to you!",
      "nm17aggrif03054_.mp3": "Okay, that's the way you want it. But when I'm rich you're going to regret saying that!",
      "nm17aggrif03058_.mp3": "Hey, sis, no need to worry about that. I've turned over a new leaf. From now on I'm going to stay out of trouble and do things right.",
      "nm17aggrif03060_.mp3": "And once we've cornered the market on Tarisian ale good things will be heading my way. Then I'll make it up to you, Mission. Just wait - you'll see!",
      "nm17aggrif03062_.mp3": "You know, once we synthesize this and start brewing Tarisian ale in mass quantities we're going to be looking for some investors.",
      "nm17aggrif03064_.mp3": "You give me a couple hundred credits and I can get you in on the ground floor. You'll get a return of... oh, at least twenty times your investment!",
      "nm17aggrif03066_.mp3": "Hey, don't worry, you'll get your credits as soon as we start mass producing that Tarisian ale. I just wanted to know if you were interested in an even bigger payoff.",
      "nm17aggrif03068_.mp3": "Wise move. I can see you really understand how business works: now, when you see your chance, you jump at it! Heh, that's my motto.",
      "nm17aggrif03070_.mp3": "I better get started on brewing that ale. Meet me back here later and I'll have a downpayment on what I owe you.",
      "nm17aggrif03073_.mp3": "You don't know much about business, do you? When an opportunity like this comes along you have to jump at it! Come on, what do you say?",
      "nm17aggrif03075_.mp3": "It's your loss. I better get started brewing that ale. Meet me back here later and I'll give you a downpayment on what I owe you.",
      "nm17aggrif03078_.mp3": "Whoa - no need to get violent. I can take the hint. I was just trying to do you a favor, but I see you're not interested.",
      "nm17aggrif03081_.mp3": "Sorry, like I said before I don't have any credits on me. And Greeta won't lend me any. It's like he doesn't trust me to pay him back or something.",
      "nm17aggrif03083_.mp3": "But you come through on this and I promise you'll get a huge payday down the road. Two... no! Three thousand credits! How's that sound?",
      "nm17aggrif03085_.mp3": "Changed your mind? No... you can't! Eh... do you know what this guy from the Exchange will do to me if I don't come through? Come on, you have to help me here!",
      "nm20aagrif05000_.mp3": "Uh... you there! I'm... I'm a high ranking executive of the Czerka Corporation! Eh... there's a big reward if you take me back to Anchorhead!",
      "nm20aagrif05002_.mp3": "Mission? Is it really you? I heard Taris was destroyed! I thought you were dead! Joy of joys, my little sister is alive!",
      "nm20aagrif05004_.mp3": "Ah, well... there's the truth and then there's the *truth*, you know? I always meant to go back to Taris, sis. Just as soon as I had the credits to pay off my debts. But credits have been hard to come by.",
      "nm20aagrif05006_.mp3": "Come on, sis. You didn't need me to look after you anymore. You may have been young, but you knew how to take care of yourself. Besides, you're here now - everything worked out fine.",
      "nm20aagrif05008_.mp3": "Uh... well, I... I wanted to thank you, and, uh, you look like you're doing well. Financially, I mean. Say... um... could you spare me a few credits to get back on my feet?",
      "nm20aagrif05010_.mp3": "Huh... that didn't go well. Sis always was a little too fiery for her own good. She'll cool down in time.",
      "nm20aagrif05012_.mp3": "Ah, she'll be okay. We've had our fights before. Too bad, though. I could really have used a helping hand right now.",
      "nm20aagrif05014_.mp3": "You may have saved my life, but I don't have a single credit to my name. Say, you wouldn't be able to spare me some credits? Just till I get back on my feet, you know?",
      "nm20aagrif05016_.mp3": "That's it, huh? Oh, figured you would be able to spare a bit more than that, but, you know, I'll take whatever I can get. Don't worry about me... I've already got a job waiting for me.",
      "nm20aagrif05017_.mp3": "Greeta, the manager over at the Czerka supply shop, said I could come work for him if I ever get tired of the mines. I think I'll go take him up on his offer.",
      "nm20aagrif05018_.mp3": "You know, maybe there's something else you can help me with. I need to talk to a guy first and set up the details, but if you're interested in a job come see me in Greeta's shop.",
      "nm20aagrif05019_.mp3": "Goodbye, Mission. Uh... I'm glad you're not dead.",
      "nm20aagrif05024_.mp3": "Huh - I... uh... guess you've been talking to Lena, too. That's okay - I'll figure out a way to get by without your credits. I always do. Besides, I've already got a job lined up for me.",
      "nm20aagrif05026_.mp3": "Ha! You're kidding, right? Look at me... do I look like I've got any reward for you?",
      "nm20aagrif05027_.mp3": "Well, that and uh... could you please get me out of here? You've got a tough looking friend there.",
      "nm20aagrif05028_.mp3": "So, uh... you're here to save me, right? I'm sure you'll get... a huge reward! Yes indeed, Mission always said some people would pay to find me.",
      "nm20aagrif05030_.mp3": "My name is Griff. You know her? Are you from Czerka Corporation? Please, tell me what's going on here!",
      "nm20aagrif05032_.mp3": "I'm her brother! She's alive? I... I can't believe it! When I heard about Taris I thought the worst! Come on, take me to her! Get me out of here!",
      "nm20aagrif05037_.mp3": "You can't abandon me here. These Sand People, they're animals.",
      "nm20aagrif05038_.mp3": "What, we've only just met and everything is about you? What about me? Mission wouldn't want me trapped here waiting for Sand People to kill me.",
      "nm20aagrif05042_.mp3": "You know I do, Mission, you know I do. Honest this time.",
      "nm20aagrif05043_.mp3": "Yeah, you do that. Mission would appreciate it. I know it. She loves me like a... well, a brother, I guess.",
      "nm20aagrif05046_.mp3": "Hey, come on now, you may as well be killing me. Get me out of here!",
      "nm20aagrif05048_.mp3": "What, no speeder escort? Okay, okay, I should just take what I can get. I sure would like to see Mission, though.",
      "nm20aagrif05049_.mp3": "She's probably waiting for you on the ship you used to come to Tatooine, right? I think I'll go to the spaceport and see her. She'd like that.",
      "nm20aagrif05050_.mp3": "Thanks again. Oh, and don't tell Mission I'm coming. I want it to be a surprise when I show up at the spaceport. I can't wait to see the look on her face.",
      "nm20aagrif05053_.mp3": "Oh, I've been thinking about a lot of things! Honest! Come on now, let me go.",
      "nm20aagrif05055_.mp3": "Hey, there's no call for that. If you know Mission like you say, you'll know she'd want me alive. I'm her dear brother.",
      "nm20aagrif05057_.mp3": "What? No! This isn't right! No!",
      "nm20aagrif05060_.mp3": "You're back! You've come to let old Griff out, right? Right? Uh... I don't want to beg, but I'm more than willing.",
      "nm20aagrif05062_.mp3": "We used to be so close, sis. Now, I know we've had our differences, but I really need to get out of here now. No fooling.",
      "nm20aagrif05064_.mp3": "Because you know, I... I think Mission would really appreciate me being alive and not at all dead."

      "nm26acignu04000_.mp3": "Shame about Sunry getting convicted like that. I guess he really did kill Elassa after all.",

      "nm26acignu04004_.mp3": "I guess Sunry didn't kill the Sith woman after all. Could have sworn he left after the shot though...",
      "nm26acignu04006_.mp3": "You're the one defending Sunry now, eh? Well, the hotel's open for you and I guess I got to answer any questions you want, too.",
      "nm26acignu04008_.mp3": "The Sith woman Elassa rented a room in the hotel. An hour or two later Sunry comes in and goes to her room. A couple hours later I hear a blaster shot and see Sunry running.",
      "nm26acignu04010_.mp3": "Sure. *wink* *wink* Sunry left before the blaster went off, so he couldn't have done it.",
      "nm26acignu04012_.mp3": "Do you need to know anything else?",
      "nm26acignu04013_.mp3": "He can't run good 'cause he's a cripple, but still he was going pretty fast. I would swear he started after the shot though.",
      "nm26acignu04015_.mp3": "Yeah, I'm pretty damn sure he left after the shot went off.",
      "nm26acignu04017_.mp3": "No, I don't think so. I mean, it's possible, just barely, but I wouldn't say that to the court.",
      "nm26acignu04019_.mp3": "[Failure] No. No way I'm lying to the court just because you want to get your Republic buddy off, or whatever. I have no interest in going to prison!",

      "nm26acignu04023_.mp3": "Alright, I'll do it. I'll tell the Selkath that he left before the shot went off, but this is our little secret. If you try and turn me in for lying, I'm making sure you come with me!",
      "nm26acignu04025_.mp3": "Now, was there anything else you wanted?",
      "nm26acignu04027_.mp3": "[Success] Yeah. I'll tell the court Sunry left before the shot went off.",

      "nm26acignu04034_.mp3": "What do you want to know?",

      "nm26acignu04042_.mp3": "Normally I don't let his kind in here - I'm a reputable business man, you know! - but there weren't many people here, so I decided to take a chance.",
      "nm26acignu04044_.mp3": "The other is a regular named Firith Me. He's a Pazaak player. Probably an addict, but he claims he's big in some circles.",

      "nm26acignu04050_.mp3": "Well, OK. If you need anything else I'm going to be right here.",
      "nm26acignu04052_.mp3": "Sorry, but the hotel is closed.",
      "nm26acignu04054_.mp3": "Ever since the murder, the Selkath have made me keep this place locked up tight. Only the Selkath authorities and those authorized by them are allowed in.",
      "nm26acignu04056_.mp3": "This old Republic war-hero by the name of Sunry was seeing this Sith woman here - Elassa.",
      "nm26acignu04058_.mp3": "Well, they were seeing each other, but the other night a blaster went off in one of the rooms. Sunry got seen leaving the place and the Sith woman was dead on the floor.",
      "nm26acignu04060_.mp3": "But not everyone thinks this Sunry did it, so the Selkath are holding him in prison while the case gets sorted out. In the meantime they close down my hotel!",

      "nm26acignu04065_.mp3": "[Failure] Ha! They sent me a list of people to let in, and they're all Selkath. Somehow, you just don't look like one.",
      "nm26acignu04067_.mp3": "[Failure] I... I... Sorry mate, but it's Selkath authorities only since the murder. You're gonna have to go someplace else to stay.",

      "nm02aemarl23006_.mp3": "Hello there, off-worlder. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Marl. I'm one of the duelists here at the cantina. I was wondering when you'd get around to talking to me.",
      "nm02aemarl23008_.mp3": "No, we've never met. It's just that most people who come here to watch the duels are bored nobles looking for a little excitement in their drab lives. But you're different.",
      "nm02aemarl23010_.mp3": "I've seen you in the dueling ring; you're serious about this. People like you scout things out, so I figured eventually you'd come to talk to me.",
      "nm02aemarl23011_.mp3": "You look like you know a thing or two about combat. I'm guessing you didn't come here to sit on the sidelines and watch a duel. Are you looking for a match?",
      "nm02aemarl23014_.mp3": "My area of expertise is pretty much limited to the dueling ring and the other combatants here at the cantina, but I'll try to answer any questions you might have.",
      "nm02aemarl23016_.mp3": "You've come to the right man. I've been dueling here for nearly twenty years and I remember every duelist who's been through this cantina.",
      "nm02aemarl23018_.mp3": "Of course, there are only five of us left now: Duncan, Gerlon, Ice, Twitch and me. Bendak Starkiller comes in once in a while, but he's retired now.",
      "nm02aemarl23020_.mp3": "Duncan? Worst duelist ever. His nickname is Deadeye because he fights like he's blind! I wouldn't worry about him.",
      "nm02aemarl23022_.mp3": "Gerlon used to be pretty good, before the accident. His blaster overheated during a match and exploded. One in a million occurrence. Paralyzed three fingers on his right hand.",
      "nm02aemarl23024_.mp3": "They call him Gerlon Two-Fingers now. He hasn't been the same since the accident, but he's still out here trying to earn a living. That's why I never fight with blasters.",
      "nm02aemarl23026_.mp3": "Ice? Eh, she's not much for personality, but she's a hell of a fighter - confident, steady. Popular with the crowd, too. If you go up against her you know you're in for a tough match.",
      "nm02aemarl23028_.mp3": "Twitch? I think that Rodian is completely crazy, but he's very, very good despite his insanity. Or maybe because of it. Even I can't beat him.",
      "nm02aemarl23030_.mp3": "Me? I've seen my share of battles. My best years are gone, but I can still hold my own against anyone in here... except maybe Twitch.",
      "nm02aemarl23032_.mp3": "What can I say? Bendak was a legend. Never lost a match his entire career. But he was bloodthirsty as an Iridorian battle rager - never liked having to face the same opponent twice.",
      "nm02aemarl23034_.mp3": "Got so he wouldn't battle anyone unless it was a death match. When they made death matches illegal, he went into retirement. He still hangs around here sometimes.",
      "nm02aemarl23036_.mp3": "Bendak's the best there ever was, plain and simple. Even now I'd bet that anyone who steps into the ring with him wouldn't make it out alive.",
      "nm02aemarl23039_.mp3": "Only what I heard from the news reports, which are all censored by the Sith. Some pods crashed into the Undercity, anyone caught harboring survivors will be arrested and executed.",
      "nm02aemarl23041_.mp3": "Really, I don't think it's any of my business. The Sith want to call themselves rulers of Taris, it's fine by me. Just so long as they don't shut the duel ring down.",
      "nm02aemarl23043_.mp3": "I can only tell you what is recorded in the basic visitor guides: the Upper City is a beautiful destination where intergalactic travelers can find all their basic needs.",
      "nm02aemarl23045_.mp3": "If you're looking for excitement the duel rings here are your best bet. Stay out of the Lower City - it's nothing but a gang ridden slum. Is there anything else you want to know?",
      "nm02aemarl23047_.mp3": "The duels themselves are simple enough. Two combatants armed with stun pistols enter the ring. One walks out a winner, the other is carried out unconscious on a stretcher.",
      "nm02aemarl23049_.mp3": "If you're interested in setting up a match - or if you want to place a wager - just go speak to Ajuur. He's that Hutt over in the corner. He'll make all the arrangements.",
      "nm02aemarl23052_.mp3": "Goodbye, stranger. Maybe we'll talk again later.",
      "nm02aemarl23054_.mp3": "Pretty impressive, Stranger. Ice is no pushover. People are starting to take notice of you. They say you're the best thing to come along since Twitch stepped into the ring. ",
      "nm02aemarl23056_.mp3": "If you're going to keep climbing the ranks, then I guess I'm next on your hit list, kid. I'm looking forward to it.",

      "nm02aczelk11036_.mp3": "[Success] What? No! Don't tell the Sith. Please. I... I can explain all this.",
      "nm02aczelk11039_.mp3": "You... you recognize these soldiers? But how? Unless... unless you're a friend of the Republic.",
      "nm02aczelk11041_.mp3": "[Success] I guess... I guess I better tell you what's going on. I only hope the Sith don't find out what I've done.",
      "nm02aczelk11043_.mp3": "What... what do you want? Are you here to threaten me again? Well, it won't do you any good. I don't have anything left for you to steal. Can't you just leave me alone?",
      "nm02aczelk11045_.mp3": "Well, I did set this facility up to help those in need, so I suppose I can't really turn you away. Very well, you can see what I have in stock.",
      "nm02aczelk11048_.mp3": "I guess I can't turn you away in good conscience. Very well, I will tend to your injuries; but then I expect you to leave my facility.",
      "nm02aczelk11051_.mp3": "I don't want any trouble, I'm just trying to keep my medical facility up and running. Please, just go away and let me do my job.",
      "nm02aczelk11053_.mp3": "I see from your appearance that you are an off-worlder. Still, you are welcome here. I'll not have it said that Zelka Forn refused to help somebody just because they weren't a citizen of Taris.",
      "nm02aczelk11055_.mp3": "Do you require healing or medical supplies? I can treat almost any injury or ailment right here at the medical facility, except the rakghoul disease, of course.",
      "nm02aczelk11057_.mp3": "The terrible affliction has plagued Taris for many generations. It is spread by the rakghouls, horrible monsters that live in the Undercity below Taris' great skyscrapers.",
      "nm02aczelk11059_.mp3": "Prolonged exposure to the Undercity breeds the disease and those infected will eventually mutate into rakghouls themselves, becoming mindless beasts that feed on the flesh of others. ",
      "nm02aczelk11061_.mp3": "There is no antidote for the disease, though I heard the Republic scientists at the military base here on Taris were close to perfecting a cure. Then the Sith arrived.",
      "nm02aczelk11063_.mp3": "They overran the military base and now they refuse to allow anyone access to the laboratories inside. The Sith are keeping all the serum for the patrols they send into the Undercity.",
      "nm02aczelk11065_.mp3": "If I could just get my hands on a sample of that serum the rakghoul disease could be wiped from the face of Taris forever. But I don't see how that's going to happen.",
      "nm02aczelk11067_.mp3": "I don't see how anyone could get their hands on the serum. The military base is crawling with Sith guards. Breaking in there would be a suicide mission.",
      "nm02aczelk11069_.mp3": "I suppose the Sith patrols in the Undercity might have a sample of the serum on them, if they hadn't already used it because of a rakghoul infection.",
      "nm02aczelk11071_.mp3": "But I doubt a patrol would just hand the serum over. And nobody's stupid enough to attack one of the Sith patrols, even in the Undercity.",
      "nm02aczelk11073_.mp3": "Please don't say that! If the Sith hear you they might think I'm suggesting you start attacking their patrols. They could shut me down!",
      "nm02aczelk11075_.mp3": "I only mentioned the serum because you asked. I don't actually expect anyone to get me the serum. Now, is there anything else I can do for you?",
      "nm02aczelk11077_.mp3": "I couldn't afford to give you more than a few medpacs and a handful of credits. The medical center can barely afford to stay open as it is. But it hardly matters, anyway.",
      "nm02aczelk11080_.mp3": "This is a hospital of sorts, though my resources are quite limited since the Sith quarantined the planet. I provide basic medical services to all citizens of and visitors to Taris.",
      "nm02aczelk11082_.mp3": "I have extensive medical training, and even with the lack of resources I can treat most injuries or ailments right here at the center - except for the rakghoul disease, of course.",
      "nm02aczelk11085_.mp3": "I am quite busy maintaining the facility, but I suppose I could spare a bit of time to answer some questions. What would you like to know?",
      "nm02aczelk11087_.mp3": "I know enough to be scared of them. I've heard about the brutality of the Sith. I know what they do to the planets they conquer.",
      "nm02aczelk11089_.mp3": "So far all they've done is ask me some general questions, but I'm afraid they might one day decide to shut this facility down simply out of evil spite.",
      "nm02aczelk11091_.mp3": "I guess there's not much I can do about the Sith, except hope that the Republic finds a way to stop their conquest of the entire galaxy.",
      "nm02aczelk11093_.mp3": "I don't know much, but I'll tell you what I can. Do you want to know about Upper Taris? Or are you more interested in Lower Taris and the Undercity?",
      "nm02aczelk11095_.mp3": "The people here in the Upper City generally like to think they're better than the rest of Taris, but we're no better than anyone else. ",
      "nm02aczelk11097_.mp3": "The people here can be selfish, greedy, arrogant and even prejudiced. That's why aliens need special permission to leave the Lower City.",
      "nm02aczelk11099_.mp3": "Maybe if more people in the Upper City weren't so self-centered things wouldn't be so bad in the Lower City and the Undercity.",
      "nm02aczelk11101_.mp3": "The Lower City has been overrun by swoop gangs and thugs. If you're going to travel down there you better go armed.",
      "nm02aczelk11103_.mp3": "If you don't get attacked by one of the swoop gangs, you'll probably end up beaten and robbed by one of Davik's thugs! Soon it will be as bad as the Undercity.",
      "nm02aczelk11105_.mp3": "Davik is the resident crime lord of Taris. He deals in stolen goods, he trades in slaves and contraband, and it would take a month to list all the people he's made \"disappear\".\n",
      "nm02aczelk11107_.mp3": "His slimy grasp even reaches here into Upper Taris. Most of the shops pay him protection money so he'll leave them alone. Yeah, the man's nothing but a thug!",
      "nm02aczelk11109_.mp3": "I guess I'm lucky. Since my medical facility doesn't make any profits Davik doesn't bother me. But if you ask me he's no better than the Sith! ",
      "nm02aczelk11111_.mp3": "The Undercity is a wasteland crawling with flesh eating mutants called rakghouls. I feel sorry for the Outcasts that are forced to live there.",
      "nm02aczelk11113_.mp3": "Justice here on Taris is swift and harsh. There are only two punishments - execution, or banishment to the Undercity.",
      "nm02aczelk11115_.mp3": "Anyone banished can never return on pain of death. Even their descendants are forced to live in the depths beneath our great cities.",
      "nm02aczelk11117_.mp3": "Whenever I can I send supplies to the Undercity to help ease the misery of their lives, although there is nothing I can do to help those infected with the rakghoul disease.",
      "nm02aczelk11118_.mp3": "Whenever I can I send supplies to the Undercity to help ease the misery of their lives - food, medpacs and serum to cure the rakghoul disease, mostly.",
      "nm02aczelk11121_.mp3": "All I know is what I was told by the people who brought these Republic soldiers here for treatment. They found the wreckage of two escape pods down in the Undercity.",
      "nm02aczelk11122_.mp3": "Republic escape pods? Uh... no... why would you ask me that? I don't know. Those pods crashed in the Undercity. I'm not involved in any way!",
      "nm02aczelk11124_.mp3": "I'm not defensive! I just don't like being accused of knowing something about those Republic pods. This is as bad as an interrogation by the Sith!",
      "nm02aczelk11126_.mp3": "[Success] Well, you don't look like you're with the Sith. I guess... I guess I can tell you my secret. Or rather, I can show you.",
      "nm02aczelk11128_.mp3": "[Failure] The Sith were already here, asking these same questions. I'll tell you what I told them. I don't know anything about those pods. Now, is there something else you need?",
      "nm02aczelk11130_.mp3": "[Success] There's no need to get the Sith involved! I guess... I guess I can tell you my secret. Or rather, I can show you.",
      "nm02aczelk11133_.mp3": "It will just take me a moment while I examine your injuries, and then I'll administer the proper treatment.",
      "nm02aczelk11136_.mp3": "Of course. Just step over here and I'll show you what I have in stock. My prices are very reasonable, just what I need to keep this facility operating.",
      "nm02aczelk11139_.mp3": "Goodbye and good health to you. If you ever need any medical aid or treatment, you know where to find me.",
      "nm02aczelk11141_.mp3": "Welcome to my medical facility. Do you require healing or treatment? I can treat almost any ailment right here at the facility.",
      "nm02aczelk11143_.mp3": "I even have supplies of the rakghoul serum in my inventory, as I have already told you. So what do you need?",
      "nm02aczelk11144_.mp3": "I even have a cure for the rakghoul disease now, thanks to you. With the sample you've brought me I've been able to extract hundreds of vials that will cure the horrible affliction. ",
      "nm02aczelk11146_.mp3": "Of course I sell them at a very reasonable price. Just enough to cover the cost of processing the sample.",
      "nm02aczelk11147_.mp3": "I can even provide a cure for the rakghoul disease, though it is very expensive. Davik has a monopoly on the antidote, and he's selling the serum for a ridiculous fee.",
      "nm02aczelk11149_.mp3": "Davik's doing everything he can to protect his monopoly. All the samples he provides are treated, making it impossible to analyze their composition and create my own stores of the serum. ",
      "nm02aczelk11150_.mp3": "Welcome back. Are you in need of healing or medical supplies? I can treat you right here at the center for almost any condition, except the rakghoul disease, of course.",
      "nm02aczelk11153_.mp3": "You have the serum? Impossible! How did you get this? No, wait... I don't really want to know.",
      "nm02aczelk11155_.mp3": "Can... can I see it? The serum, I mean? I need to see if there is enough for me to analyze it so I can start producing it in mass quantities.",
      "nm02aczelk11158_.mp3": "I'm not a wealthy man. All I can offer is a handful of credits and a few extra medpacs.",
      "nm02aczelk11160_.mp3": "Hmmm.... let me see... yes, this is it! A cure for the rakghoul disease! With this sample I can make enough serum for everyone!",
      "nm02aczelk11162_.mp3": "The people of Taris owe you a debt they can never repay. Please, take this small reward. It isn't much, but it's all I can afford: a few credits and two spare medpacs.",
      "nm02aczelk11164_.mp3": "You truly have a noble and generous spirit, but you deserve something for your effort. Tell you what, I'll give you a discount whenever you shop at my store. It's the least I can do.",
      "nm02aczelk11168_.mp3": "Now, is there anything else I can do for you?",
      "nm02aczelk11170_.mp3": "I appreciate everything you've done. There are many who would have sold the serum to the crime lord Davik for a much higher sum.",
      "nm02aczelk11174_.mp3": "[Success] I suppose I could give you a discount here at my shop, in addition to the credits and medpacs. Other than that there is really nothing else I can offer.",
      "nm02aczelk11176_.mp3": "[Failure] I'm sorry, but all my credits are spent trying to keep this medical facility operating. I can't spare anymore.",
      "nm02aczelk11178_.mp3": "You're threatening me? I... I don't want this to become violent. Look, here's an extra fifty credits. That's all I have, I swear!",
      "nm02aczelk11180_.mp3": "I won't tell anyone. I promise. Now please, just leave me alone. ",
      "nm02aczelk11188_.mp3": "The only other buyer would be the crime lord Davik; but he would charge exorbitant fees for the serum if he got his hands on it! Nobody would be able to afford a cure!",
      "nm02aczelk11190_.mp3": "Consider giving the serum to this man... surely we do not have such a dire need for credits that you would prize them over mercy?",
      "nm02aczelk11192_.mp3": "Please, if you have any compassion at all you'll give the serum to me and not to Davik. Don't let him get a monopoly on this cure.",
      "nm02aczelk11194_.mp3": "Then I guess there's nothing I can do to stop you. I only hope you'll change your mind later on."

      "nm22aadaso07007_.mp3": "That Thaylian bog-slime. Do you know that I have been here 36 days, slaving to pay a debt in good faith?",
      "nm22aadaso07008_.mp3": "All for nothing. He killed my crew... who knows where my ship is. Well, there's your pay, Eli. Blaster fire, and keep the change.",
      "nm22aadaso07010_.mp3": "I suppose it does, though maybe I should keep it up for a while on my own. I've no ship at the moment anyway.",
      "nm22aadaso07011_.mp3": "It'll probably take a while to convince Eli's suppliers that I'm the new boss, but eventually I'll buy my way off this rock.",
      "nm22aadaso07013_.mp3": "All right then. Actually, I feel I owe you something. Here, take a few credits. If you spend it here, all the better. I think things are looking up.",
      "nm22aadaso07015_.mp3": "Well, that's your opinion, I guess, but I still owe you for helping me. Here, take a few credits with you. Spend them here, if you like.",
      "nm22aadaso07016_.mp3": "Safe flying to you. Hope to see you again.",
      "nm22aadaso07018_.mp3": "What do you mean? I don't need to go hunting Eli's family or anything. I've seen justice done.",

      "nm22aadaso07021_.mp3": "I see your point. I'll leave his shop like his corpse. I'll take what I want, buy passage on a ship, and never look back except to spit.",

      "nm22aadaso07023_.mp3": "[Failure] I'd rather move on, you know? I don't want to be mad about this for the rest of my life. I can make this work.",
      "nm22aadaso07025_.mp3": "[Success] Working here when I was trapped was hell enough. Staying here now is just foolish. I don't want to be seen as weak.",
      "nm22aadaso07028_.mp3": "All right then. Here, I should toss you a few credits for helping. I appreciate what you did.",
      "nm22aadaso07030_.mp3": "That's the idea. Actually, I should toss you a few credits for helping me out. Take them... maybe even spend them here.",
      "nm22aadaso07032_.mp3": "Well, there's not much for me to do but stay here. I've no ship, so I may as well make a few credits.",
      "nm22aadaso07034_.mp3": "Well, I could have shot out his legs and let him crawl around for a while, but I consider this far more merciful.",
      "nm22aadaso07035_.mp3": "What did you expect I'd do? Besides, he'd have killed me. He couldn't have risked me telling everyone he was a cheat. He'd have no business.",
      "nm22aadaso07036_.mp3": "Greetings to you. Something I can get for you?",
      "nm22aadaso07038_.mp3": "I think you'd better talk to Eli directly. He's the boss... for the time being.",
      "nm22aaelix08001_.mp3": "Just be sure to pay cash. The interest on his loans will drain you like a Deluvian fatworm on a Hutt's backside.",

      "nm22aaelix08007_.mp3": "Mere rubbish? It's D-A02, the repair droid from my ship! What was this doing in the forest?",
      "nm22aaelix08009_.mp3": "Oh, there will be a reward, all right. Eli! You told me my crew jacked our ship without paying the repair bill!",
      "nm22aaelix08011_.mp3": "And what? I thought I owed you! You tricked them into the Shadowlands and killed them all while I fixed your freighter in orbit!",
      "nm22aaelix08015_.mp3": "This is business? Maybe in Hutt Space, but not here! Not with me!",
      "nm22aaelix08017_.mp3": "Eli, you snake! You said my crew jacked the ship without paying the repair bill! ",
      "nm22aaelix08020_.mp3": "What... what kind of droid?",
      "nm22aaelix08025_.mp3": "What? I'd really like to see this droid.",
      "nm22aaelix08028_.mp3": "I really want to see this thing. This sounds very odd.",
      "nm22aaelix08037_.mp3": "Yeah, it turns out Wookiees don't want to be slaves. Like most people.",
      "nm22aaelix08044_.mp3": "He means they don't tolerate cheats.",
      "nm22aaelix08050_.mp3": "I know, I know, it's standard trading rules. I just want to know where my crew went. I was only gone for two days. This isn't like them.",
      "nm22aaelix08058_.mp3": "You'll get your money. My crew will be back.",
      "nm22aaelix08062_.mp3": "Oh, you flatter me, Eli. I guess we're best buddies now.",
      "nm22aaelix08066_.mp3": "Thanks, but no thanks. No offense, but there's no point in exchanging debt to Eli with debt to you.",

      "nm11aagado02023_.mp3": "The Vulkars stripped those pods clean within hours after they landed. It's too bad we didn't get there first, considering what my spies reported the Vulkars found.",
      "nm11aagado02025_.mp3": "A female Republic officer named Bastila survived the crash. We Beks don't believe in intergalactic slavery, but the Vulkars aren't so picky. They took her prisoner.",
      "nm11aagado02027_.mp3": "Normally the Vulkars would take a captured slave and sell them for a nice profit to Davik or an off-world slaver. But a Republic officer is no ordinary catch.",
      "nm11aagado02031_.mp3": "She's too valuable to leave with the Vulkar scum at the base. Brejik's probably got your Republic friend hidden away somewhere safe until the big swoop race. You'll never find her.",
      "nm11aagado02034_.mp3": "I'm afraid your friend has become a pawn in Brejik's game to take over the Lower City. He's offered her up as the Vulkar's share of the prize in the annual swoop gang race.",
      "nm11aagado02036_.mp3": "By putting up such a valuable prize Brejik hopes to win the loyalty of some of the smaller gangs. Their numbers will allow him to finally destroy me and my followers.",
      "nm11aagado02040_.mp3": "The only hope you have of rescuing Bastila is to somehow win the big season opener of the swoop race.",
      "nm11aagado02042_.mp3": "I might be able to help you with this, if you'd be willing to help us. We both have something to gain here - and much to lose.",
      "nm11aagado02044_.mp3": "The swoop race is for the Lower City gangs only. I could sponsor you as a rider for the Hidden Beks this year. If you win the race, you'll win your friend's freedom. ",
      "nm11aagado02046_.mp3": "But first you have to do something for me. My mechanics have developed an accelerator for a swoop engine. A bike with the accelerator installed can beat any other swoop out there! ",
      "nm11aagado02048_.mp3": "But the Vulkars stole the prototype from us. They plan to use it to guarantee a victory in this year's swoop race. I need you to break into their base and steal it back.",
      "nm11aagado02050_.mp3": "Getting into the Vulkar base won't be easy - the front doors are locked tight. But I know someone who might be able to get you in the back way - Mission Vao.",
      "nm11aagado02054_.mp3": "Mission's explored every step of every back alley in the Lower City. Plus she knows the Undercity sewers better than anyone. If anyone can get inside the Vulkar base, it's her.",
      "nm11aagado02056_.mp3": "She and her Wookiee friend Zaalbar are always looking to stir up a little excitement. They like to go exploring in the Undercity, despite the dangers.",
      "nm11aagado02058_.mp3": "Your best bet is to look for her in the Undercity. But you'll need some way past the Sith guard post at the elevator. ",
      "nm11aagado02060_.mp3": "A simple disguise might have worked on the Upper City guard, but the security down here is much tougher. You'll need the proper papers to get past him.",
      "nm11aagado02062_.mp3": "Luckily my gang ambushed one of the Sith patrols headed down to the Undercity. They never made it, and their security papers fell into my hands.",
      "nm11aagado02064_.mp3": "Since we're working together now I suppose I could give them to you in exchange for your uniforms. With the security papers you won't need a disguise anyway.",
      "nm11aagado02066_.mp3": "The disguise won't help you get into the Undercity. Besides, soon the Sith will realize they've got a few too many uniforms missing and the only way to get around will be the security papers.",
      "nm11aagado02068_.mp3": "I like to be prepared. Eventually the Sith are going to try to drive us out of the Undercity. Sith disguises might give my people the edge we need in a crucial battle!",
      "nm11aagado02070_.mp3": "Good choice. Thanks for the uniforms. You won't need them with these security papers anyway. Now, is there anything else I can do for you?",
      "nm11aagado02073_.mp3": "Don't underestimate Mission or her Wookiee friend Zaalbar. They're a formidable pair; tough enough to go exploring the Undercity by themselves!",
      "nm11aagado02076_.mp3": "My word is my bond. Everybody in the Lower City knows my reputation. Besides, you really don't have a choice. I'm your only ticket into the swoop race.",
      "nm11aagado02078_.mp3": "Don't be a fool. You have to win the swoop race to save your friend, and that means breaking into the Vulkar base and getting my prototype accelerator back.",
      "nm11aagado02081_.mp3": "You're in no position to bargain here. Without my help, you don't have a hope of getting this Bastila back. You should at least listen to what I have to say.",
      "nm11aagado02084_.mp3": "You really don't have any other choice. Not if you want to get Bastila back. You should at least listen to what I have to say.",
      "nm11aagado02093_.mp3": "Think about it, Zaerdra: the Republic officer the Vulkars captured; all the escape pods crashing on Taris; an off-worlder desperate to get inside the Vulkar base. It's obvious.",
      "nm11aagado02097_.mp3": "Your time would probably be better spent going after the prototype swoop engine the Vulkars stole from us, but I'll answer your questions if I can.",
      "nm11aagado02098_.mp3": "I don't see any harm in that. What did you want to know?",
      "nm11aagado02105_.mp3": "Calm down, Zaerdra... I'm not ashamed of what I have become. As you can see, I lost my eyes in a swoop racing crash. I rely on these artificial replacements to see now.",
      "nm11aagado02107_.mp3": "But my blindness was not the worst consequence of my accident. My affliction was what eventually led to this war between my Beks and the Vulkars.",
      "nm11aagado02109_.mp3": "When I lost my sight in the swoop bike accident everyone assumed I would step down as leader of the Hidden Beks and let Brejik - my most trusted follower - take over.",
      "nm11aagado02111_.mp3": "But with my occular implants I can still see well enough to lead this gang, and I knew Brejik wasn't ready to take over yet. Unfortunately, Brejik didn't agree with me. ",
      "nm11aagado02113_.mp3": "In a rage he left to join our arch rivals, the Black Vulkars. A lot of the younger gang members followed him, and soon he and his followers had taken control of the Vulkar gang.",
      "nm11aagado02115_.mp3": "Brejik is a proud man. My decision was a public humiliation for him. Maybe if I had stepped down this gang war could have been avoided. ",
      "nm11aagado02119_.mp3": "*sigh* I know you're right, Zaerdra. Brejik won't rest until I am dead and the Beks are no more, but it's hard to accept the truth of his betrayal.",
      "nm11aagado02124_.mp3": "Not while the Sith quarantine is in place. Even the fastest smugglers' ships can't break the blockade of the fleet surrounding the planet without the proper launch codes.",
      "nm11aagado02126_.mp3": "Any ship leaving the Taris atmosphere without the proper codes would be instantly disintegrated by blaster cannons fired by the Sith fleet's automated targeting systems.",
      "nm11aagado02128_.mp3": "Feel free to come back anytime. We're not like those Vulkar savages - strangers are welcome in the Bek base. ",
      "nm11aagado02130_.mp3": "You have returned. Do you have the prototype swoop engine accelerator with you?",
      "nm11aagado02133_.mp3": "I was beginning to wonder if you would make it. The race is tomorrow, and my mechanics need time to install the prototype into the swoop engine of our bike.",
      "nm11aagado02135_.mp3": "Don't worry, I'm a man of my word. I promised you could ride in the swoop race under the Hidden Bek banner, and I'm still going to let you do that.",
      "nm11aagado02137_.mp3": "And I'm even going to go one better - I'm going to let you ride the swoop bike with the prototype accelerator installed on it. Without it, you won't stand a chance.",
      "nm11aagado02141_.mp3": "I have to be honest with you - there's a reason I'm letting you take the prototype engine. The accelerator isn't stable; there's a good chance it could explode during the race.",
      "nm11aagado02143_.mp3": "I can't ask one of my own riders to take the risk - they'll be running unmodified swoops in the race. You'll be the only one using the prototype.",
      "nm11aagado02145_.mp3": "If you can complete the track before the accelerator overheats then you'll win for the Beks. If you die, then one of my other riders could still come through for me.",
      "nm11aagado02147_.mp3": "You don't get to be leader of a swoop gang if you don't know how to work all the angles.",
      "nm11aagado02149_.mp3": "You can stay here tonight. The mechanics need time to install the accelerator on the engine, so you won't be able to practice your riding.",
      "nm11aagado02151_.mp3": "But I've got good instincts, and you have the look of a racer about you. Just try to relax and in the morning we'll take you to the swoop track.",
      "nm11aagado02154_.mp3": "Without that prototype you don't stand a chance of winning. And if you don't win you can't get Bastila back - none of the other riders will give her up. This is your only chance.",
      "nm11aagado02158_.mp3": "A reward? I'm blind, but I'm not stupid. Your reward is the chance to ride in the big swoop race so you can win Bastila's freedom.",
      "nm11aagado02160_.mp3": "We had a deal, so I expect you to honor it. If we don't honor our deals, what's to stop me from just taking the prototype from you and leaving you for dead?",
      "nm11aagado02163_.mp3": "Time is running out, you know. If you don't come up with that accelerator you won't have a chance against the Vulkars in the swoop race.",
      "nm11aagado02165_.mp3": "If you want to save this Bastila then you better get that accelerator back from the Vulkars.",
      "nm11aagado02167_.mp3": "I suggest you hurry. The swoop race is coming up, and we want you to have time to practice before the race.",
      "nm11aagado02169_.mp3": "Back again? At least this time Zaerdra didn't verbally assault you for coming to see me.",
      "nm11aagado02171_.mp3": "I trust her with my life, but she does take her guard duties rather seriously ever since this war with Brejik and the Vulkars began. Now, what do you need from me?",
      "nm11aazaer09002_.mp3": "Calm down, Zaerdra. Nobody is going to try anything here in the middle of our own base. It would be a suicide mission.",
      "nm11aazaer09006_.mp3": "Do you want us to start attacking strangers on sight, Zaerdra - like the Vulkars do? I will never let it come to that! Now step aside and let them pass.",

      "nm02aeyung26021_.mp3": "The truth is I find your offer rather tempting. I could probably get you some uniforms. But if we get caught we're dead. You're asking me to take an awful risk.",
      "nm02aeyung26022_.mp3": "If I'm going to do this, it's going to cost you. 200 credits up front if you want to get inside the base. No more, no less. So how about it - we have a deal?",
      "nm02aeyung26025_.mp3": "[Success] Hmmm... 100 credits is a small fortune. I'll never have the chance to make that much in one shot again.",
      "nm02aeyung26026_.mp3": "Okay, you've got a deal. The trick is to get you the uniforms without the Sith knowing I gave them to you. But I've got a plan.",
      "nm02aeyung26027_.mp3": "I'm going to a party with some of the other soldiers tonight. Most people are coming right after their shift, so they'll have their uniforms with them.",
      "nm02aeyung26028_.mp3": "You show up and I'll make sure everyone else gets good and drunk. When we pass out you can take our uniforms from the lockbox in the apartment.",
      "nm02aeyung26030_.mp3": "I'll probably get a reprimand for not locking it up, but that's about it. Then, in another month I'll resign and retire with all those credits you gave me.",
      "nm02aeyung26031_.mp3": "Here - I'll add the address of the party to your datapad. Show up there later. To be on the safe side we shouldn't speak again before or after the party.",
      "nm02aeyung26032_.mp3": "I'll go make all the arrangements and I'll see you at the party tonight. Just remember - if you get caught with those uniforms, I don't know you.",
      "nm02aeyung26034_.mp3": "We're in this together now. If either one of us goes to the Sith we'll both end up in the torture chambers. Anyway, it's not like you have a choice.",
      "nm02aeyung26035_.mp3": "I'm not giving you your credits back, so you might as well show up at the party later and take the uniforms after we all get drunk and pass out. What could be more simple?",
      "nm02aeyung26037_.mp3": "[Failure] Look, I'm not going to risk my neck unless I get a big payday. 200 credits or no deal.",
      "nm02aeyung26039_.mp3": "Sorry to hear that, but I won't put my neck on the line for nothing! Tell you what - you come up with the credits and we can talk. Otherwise, no deal.",
      "nm02aeyung26042_.mp3": "You... you weren't serious? Oh... okay. Although if you *were* serious, we might be able to work something out. No - wait! Forget I said that! We shouldn't be talking like this.",
      "nm02aeyung26043_.mp3": "I might complain a lot, but it's a big step from complaining to treason. I think maybe we should end this conversation - for both our sakes.",
      "nm02aeyung26045_.mp3": "The senior officers don't really like it when we start answering questions, you know? They don't want us fraternizing with the locals. Just another \"perk\" of the job.",
      "nm02aeyung26046_.mp3": "No offense, but I probably shouldn't be talking to you anymore. I'm liable to say something that might get me in trouble.",
      "nm02aeyung26048_.mp3": "Oh... okay. Well, see you around. Say, do me a favor and don't repeat all the stuff I just told you. Eh, might not go over well with my superiors.",
      "nm02aeyung26050_.mp3": "Hey, there. I didn't think we'd be chatting again so soon. You took off on me pretty quick last time.",
      "nm02aeyung26051_.mp3": "Back again? Didn't I make myself clear enough? The senior Sith officers don't like us fraternizing with the locals. Besides, I don't need you lecturing me for my career choice.",
      "nm02aeyung26053_.mp3": "Good. Move along and leave me alone or I might have to run you in for questioning.",
      "nm02aeyung26054_.mp3": "Hi there - I haven't seen you around before. Of course they don't give us Sith officers from the military base much time off...",
      "nm02aeyung26056_.mp3": "I'm off duty right now, so I'm not in uniform. My name is Yun Genda - junior officer first class with the Sith occupation force.",
      "nm02aeyung26057_.mp3": "I'm actually a little surprised you're talking to me at all... most of the people here on Taris can't stand us Sith. It can make this a pretty lonely job.",
      "nm02aeyung26059_.mp3": "[Success] That's true, but people don't appreciate what we've done for them. We could have slapped a curfew on this whole planet, but we didn't.",
      "nm02aeyung26060_.mp3": "[Failure] Save the sympathetic best friend act. I'm not buying it.",
      "nm02aeyung26061_.mp3": "But I don't want to fill out a bunch of paperwork on my day off, so let's just pretend this conversation never happened. Now move along.",
      "nm02aeyung26063_.mp3": "Oh, great... I see where this is going: the Sith are evil; why did I join them; blah, blah, blah. I don't need a lecture from the likes of you. ",
      "nm02aeyung26065_.mp3": "Ah, it's okay. I might have overreacted a bit. But can you blame me? Everywhere I look I see one of you Tarisians glaring at me with hate in your eyes.",
      "nm02aeyung26067_.mp3": "Don't try to analyze me. I'm just doing my job - same as any other soldier in any other army. Besides, I don't have to explain myself to you!",
      "nm02aeyung26068_.mp3": "I don't think we have much else to say to each other. Let's just keep this civil and go our separate ways, okay?",
      "nm02aeyung26070_.mp3": "You're an off-worlder? Huh, I figured you'd be even more angry, being stuck on a foreign planet and all.",
      "nm02aeyung26072_.mp3": "[Success] You're right! It's like everyone on this backwater planet is in a permanent bad mood. Don't they know they have to make the best of things?",
      "nm02aeyung26074_.mp3": "You know, it's like everyone on this backwater planet is in a permanent bad mood. Don't they know they have to make the best of things?",
      "nm02aeyung26076_.mp3": "Exactly! It's all about attitude. I didn't ask to be assigned to this backwater planet, but I try to make the best of it!",
      "nm02aeyung26077_.mp3": "It's pretty easy to get depressed on an assignment like this, but we do what we can to keep our spirits up.",
      "nm02aeyung26079_.mp3": "That's true. It's nice to meet someone who understands what I'm going through. It's good to talk about this stuff - it gets pretty lonely up at the military base.",
      "nm02aeyung26080_.mp3": "I have to get going soon - I've got a shift at the military base. But some of us junior Sith officers are having a party tonight to blow off some steam.",
      "nm02aeyung26081_.mp3": "I'd really like to see you again. Why don't you drop by the party? I'll show you where it is on your map.",
      "nm02aeyung26083_.mp3": "Don't be late. We're starting right after our shifts end. Most of us won't even be going back to the base to lock up our uniforms. I look forward to seeing you there.",
      "nm02aeyung26085_.mp3": "Just because I'm with the Sith doesn't mean I don't know how to have a good time. You'll enjoy yourself. I promise.",
      "nm02aeyung26089_.mp3": "First you come over and say hi, then you scurry off as soon as you find out I'm a Sith soldier. You Tarisians are a funny bunch."

      "nm26aatria27228_.mp3": "Lies! Slander! I object!",

      "nm26aatria27329_.mp3": "I think we can see the answer clear enough, Mr. Sunry!",

      "nm02adyung12010_.mp3": "Who cares? We're not on duty tomorrow - let's live a little! Come on - drink up!",
      "nm02adyung12012_.mp3": "I'm surprised to see you again. I thought you had gotten sick of me complaining about my job at the Sith military base. I guess I kind of obsess about it. That can't be healthy.",
      "nm02adyung12014_.mp3": "Well, are you here to close our deal? 2000 credits gets you access to the Military Base. Otherwise we really shouldn't be talking.",
      "nm02adyung12015_.mp3": "Sorry, but I'm not here looking for conversation. I just came to get a drink, listen to some music and try to relax before my next shift at the military base.",
      "nm02adyung12017_.mp3": "I don't wear my uniform when I'm off duty. I can do without those hate filled stares while I'm trying to enjoy myself.",
      "nm02adyung12019_.mp3": "I shouldn't even be here, to tell the truth. The officers get pretty upset when we fraternize with the locals. But it gets pretty stale hanging around the base all the time.",
      "nm02adyung12021_.mp3": "Besides, the Sith don't own me. Being a soldier in their fleet is just a job, you know? A job with long hours and low pay, I might add.",
      "nm02adyung12023_.mp3": "When I signed up I was promised adventure and excitement in exotic locals. Instead, I end up stationed at a military base on some backwater planet on the fringes of the galaxy.",
      "nm02adyung12025_.mp3": "If I could just find some other way to earn some credits I could give up this lousy job. It's not like they even need me there. Nobody can get into the base without a keycard.",
      "nm02adyung12027_.mp3": "I don't have the card with me. But everyone who works at the military base has one. Otherwise we wouldn't be able to get inside the base. ",
      "nm02adyung12029_.mp3": "What? Are you offering me a bribe? You realize this is treason, right? If I report you the Sith will have you executed!",
      "nm02adyung12031_.mp3": "Hey, now - let's not start making threats. I didn't say I *would* report you, only that I could. This kind of talk is dangerous, you know? But I'm not going to turn you in.",
      "nm02adyung12034_.mp3": "The truth is I find your offer rather tempting. I could probably get you inside the base. But if we get caught we're dead. You're asking me to take an awful risk.",
      "nm02adyung12036_.mp3": "If I'm going to do this, it's going to cost you. 2000 credits up front if you want to get inside the base. No more, no less. So how about it - we have a deal?",
      "nm02adyung12039_.mp3": "[Success] Hmmm... 1000 credits is a small fortune. I'll never have the chance to make that much in one shot again.",
      "nm02adyung12041_.mp3": "Okay, you've got a deal. All you need to get inside the base is my keycard. The trick is to get it to you without the Sith knowing I gave it to you. But I've got a plan.",
      "nm02adyung12043_.mp3": "I'm going to a party with some of the other Sith soldiers tonight. You show up and I'll make sure everyone else gets good and drunk. When we pass out you can take my keycard.",
      "nm02adyung12045_.mp3": "I'll probably get a reprimand for carrying my keycard while not on duty, but nothing too serious. Then, in another month I'll resign and retire with all those credits you gave me.",
      "nm02adyung12047_.mp3": "Here - I'll add the address of the party to your datapad. Show up there later. To be on the safe side we shouldn't speak again before or after the party.",
      "nm02adyung12051_.mp3": "I'll go make all the arrangements and I'll see you at the party later. Just remember - if you get caught breaking into the base, I don't know you.",
      "nm02adyung12054_.mp3": "We're in this together now. If either one of us goes to the Sith we'll both end up in the torture chambers. Anyway, it's not like you have a choice.",
      "nm02adyung12056_.mp3": "I'm not giving you your credits back, so you might as well show up at the party later and take the keycard after we all get drunk and pass out. What could be more simple?",
      "nm02adyung12058_.mp3": "[Failure] Look, I'm not going to risk my neck unless I get a big payday. 2000 credits or no deal.",
      "nm02adyung12060_.mp3": "Sorry to hear that, but I won't put my neck on the line for nothing! Tell you what - you come up with the credits and we can talk. Otherwise, no deal.",
      "nm02adyung12064_.mp3": "You... you weren't serious? Oh... okay. Although if you *were* serious, we might be able to work something out. No - wait! Forget I said that! We shouldn't be talking like this.",
      "nm02adyung12066_.mp3": "I might complain a lot, but it's a big step from complaining to treason. I think maybe we should end this conversation - for both our sakes.",
      "nm02adyung12069_.mp3": "Oh... okay. I'll see you around. Say, do me a favor and don't repeat all the stuff I just told you. Eh, might not go over well with my superiors.",
      "nm02adyung12072_.mp3": "Hey, there. I didn't think we'd be chatting again so soon. You took off on me pretty quick last time.",
      "nm02adyung12074_.mp3": "Back again? Didn't I make myself clear enough? The senior Sith officers don't like us fraternizing with the locals. Besides, I don't need you lecturing me for my career choice.",
      "nm02adyung12076_.mp3": "Good. Move along and leave me alone or I might have to run you in for questioning.",
      "nm02adyung12078_.mp3": "Hi there - I haven't seen you around before. Of course they don't give us Sith officers from the military base much time off...",
      "nm02adyung12080_.mp3": "I'm off duty right now, so I'm not in uniform. My name is Yun Genda - junior officer first class with the Sith occupation force.",
      "nm02adyung12082_.mp3": "I'm actually a little surprised you're talking to me at all... most of the people here on Taris can't stand us Sith. It can make this a pretty lonely job.",
      "nm02adyung12084_.mp3": "[Success] That's true, but people don't appreciate what we've done for them. We could have slapped a curfew on this whole planet, but we didn't.",
      "nm02adyung12086_.mp3": "[Failure] Save the sympathetic best friend act. I'm not buying it.\n",
      "nm02adyung12088_.mp3": "But I don't want to fill out a bunch of paperwork on my day off, so let's just pretend this conversation never happened. Now move along.",
      "nm02adyung12091_.mp3": "Oh, great... I see where this is going: the Sith are evil; why did I join them; blah, blah, blah. I don't need a lecture from the likes of you. ",
      "nm02adyung12093_.mp3": "Ah, it's okay. I might have overreacted a bit. But hey, can you blame me? Everywhere I look I see one of you Tarisians glaring at me with hate in your eyes.",
      "nm02adyung12095_.mp3": "Don't try to analyze me. I'm just doing my job - same as any other soldier in any other army. Besides, I don't have to explain myself to you!",
      "nm02adyung12097_.mp3": "I don't think we have much else to say to each other. Let's just keep this civil and go our separate ways, okay?",
      "nm02adyung12100_.mp3": "You're an off-worlder? Huh, I figured you'd be even more angry, being stuck on a foreign planet and all.",
      "nm02adyung12103_.mp3": "You know, it's like everyone on this backwater planet is in a permanent bad mood. Don't they know they have to make the best of things?",
      "nm02adyung12105_.mp3": "Exactly! It's all about attitude. I didn't ask to be assigned to this backwater planet, but I try to make the best of it!",
      "nm02adyung12107_.mp3": "It's pretty easy to get depressed on an assignment like this, but we do what we can to keep our spirits up.",
      "nm02adyung12109_.mp3": "That's true. It's nice to meet someone who understands what I'm going through. It's good to talk about this stuff - it gets pretty lonely up at the military base.",
      "nm02adyung12111_.mp3": "I have to get going soon - I've got a shift at the military base. But some of us junior Sith officers are having a party later to blow off some steam.",
      "nm02adyung12113_.mp3": "I'd really like to see you again. Why don't you drop by the party? I'll show you where it is on your map.",
      "nm02adyung12115_.mp3": "Don't worry - you won't be the only civilian there. A few of the locals who don't hate us are going to show up, too. I hope to see you there. ",
      "nm02adyung12121_.mp3": "First you come over and say hi, then you scurry off as soon as you find out I'm a Sith soldier. You Tarisians are a funny bunch."

      "nm08aadavs11023_.mp3": "He was caught trying to steal some spice from the lab. Normally Hudrow is allowed to get away with things like that because he's Davik's personal pilot for the Ebon Hawk.",

      "nm26adrepa01021_.mp3": "Well, for the kolto, of course. Really that's the only reason anyone would want to be here. It's the only reason the Selkath built Ahto City in the first place: to export kolto.",
      "nm26adrepa01023_.mp3": "Um... It's big. Real big. Actually it's pretty much the only real city on the entire world. The only place for us air-breathers anyway.",

      "nm26adrepa01028_.mp3": "Sorry, but everyone knows what kolto is. The most powerful healing agent in the galaxy. I would've died several times myself if we didn't have this stuff handy.",
      "nm26adrepa01029_.mp3": "But the reason it's important here is that kolto is only found naturally on Manaan, and all of our attempts to synthesize it have failed miserably.",
      "nm26adrepa01030_.mp3": "So we sit here on the surface, the Selkath harvesting what kolto bubbles up from the bottom of the ocean, and we buy it from them.",
      "nm26adrepa01031_.mp3": "Us and the Sith of course. The Selkath don't want to play favorites.",
      "nm26adrepa01033_.mp3": "The Selkath think that by staying neutral they can play both sides, selling kolto to everyone that needs it, and making themselves too valuable to be worth conquering.",
      "nm26adrepa01034_.mp3": "Well, that, and they threatened to destroy the only natural source of kolto on the planet if anyone tries to attack them.",
      "nm26adrepa01035_.mp3": "But I think they're underestimating the lengths the Sith will go to get what they want... They're probably planning something already.",

      "nm04aagend05002_.mp3": "Why have you come into this dark and sunless place? Is there something you need of me or my village? I will help you however I can.",
      "nm04aagend05004_.mp3": "We are the Outcasts - shunned from the surface for our crimes and banished here to the Undercity. We banded together to form this village that we might survive in this hostile environment.",
      "nm04aagend05006_.mp3": "I am Gendar, the leader of this village: as my father was, and as was his father before him. Many of us have been here for generations, our ancestors cast down long ago.",
      "nm04aagend05008_.mp3": "There is no return to the surface for us, or our descendants. But somehow we manage to survive amidst the filth and roaming bands of deadly rakghouls.",
      "nm04aagend05010_.mp3": "Life down here can be difficult. It can break the spirit... many in the village have become bitter and hopeless. Especially those newly cast down.",
      "nm04aagend05012_.mp3": "But life goes on, and we must try to make the best of what we have. And maybe someday we will find a better life... Ha! Listen to me. I'm starting to sound like Rukil.",
      "nm04aagend05014_.mp3": "The oldest man in the village. He is a kind soul, but I am afraid he is growing weary of this world. He dreams of escaping, of finding a better world.",
      "nm04aagend05016_.mp3": "If you wish to speak to him you can probably find him wandering about the village. As I said, a kind man - though he does cling to his illusions.",

      "nm04aagend05022_.mp3": "The rakghouls are monsters, hideous mutations who feast on the flesh of our villagers. Their diseased jaws can infect those they attack, transforming the victim into one of those abominations.",
      "nm04aagend05024_.mp3": "Thanks to you some of those who have been infected are now saved, but the rakghouls are still a terrible menace to our village.",
      "nm04aagend05025_.mp3": "We know of no cure for the disease, and for the good of the village we must banish any who become infected, lest they transform and turn on us.",
      "nm04aagend05027_.mp3": "Ah, you have been speaking with Rukil. I am afraid the Promised Land is nothing but a legend. If such a place existed it surely would have been found by now.",
      "nm04aagend05029_.mp3": "Rukil is a good man, but he is old and tired. He needs to cling to his illusion to keep his spirit alive. I, on the other hand, have to be more practical. The village relies on me.",
      "nm04aagend05031_.mp3": "Our village has seen many visitors from the surface recently: armored troops, swoop gang members, mercenaries. They come to search our sunless world. They are even searching the sewers.",
      "nm04aagend05033_.mp3": "You are generous to offer this to us, up-worlder... you have my thanks. But I know nothing of administering the serum. You should bring it to the village healer.",
      "nm04aagend05035_.mp3": "As you wish, up-worlder. Should you have need of anything else, come speak to me. I represent the entire village and I will do my best to help you however I can.",
      "nm04aagend05038_.mp3": "I am no beggar, though many from the surface think me a far lower creature! We have our pride, despite what those from the surface think of us.",
      "nm04aagend05039_.mp3": "You have done a great thing for my village, up-worlder. Few from the surface would bother to cure an Outcast of the rakghoul disease, as you have done.",
      "nm04aagend05041_.mp3": "My only regret is that I have no reward to give you for your aid, save my thanks and the thanks of my people.",
      "nm04aagend05042_.mp3": "Welcome back, up-worlder. I am surprised to see you again. Many of your kind have passed through our village recently, but few have bothered to speak with me or my people.",
      "nm04aagend05045_.mp3": "There are two entrances into the sewers from the Undercity: one to the north-east of our village, the other to the south-east. But the sewers are dangerous, UpWorlder.",
      "nm04aagend05046_.mp3": "If you dare to travel those dark tunnels you would be wise to go heavily armed, unless you wish to become a meal for the rakghouls and other foul creatures."

      "nm17ae04sf07017_.mp3": "If the circuit were up you'd be famous one three... no! Four worlds by now. You're just that good!",
      "nm17ae04sf07018_.mp3": "That last race of yours was the most exciting thing to blow through Tatooine... ever.",

      "nm26acrepd07059_.mp3": "Don't be foolish! If the Republic's role in this is discovered, I will be sure the blame rests on your shoulders as well. We share a secret - and we will share the consequences if the secret is revealed. ",
      "nm26acrepd07060_.mp3": "For both our sakes you should move on. Our conversation attracts undue attention.",
      "nm26acrepd07061_.mp3": "When you are ready to explore the Hrakert Rift, enter the Republic base. In the kolto packing room there is a door leading to the Republic submarines.",

      "nm26acrepd07067_.mp3": "There are several leads we have been working on to get into the Sith base. Any of them should work for you, although it might be wise to concentrate your efforts on just one.",
      "nm26acrepd07068_.mp3": "The first method that's possible is to help us interrogate a Sith prisoner we managed to catch after he tried to infiltrate our base. He is being held just inside our enclave.",
      "nm26acrepd07069_.mp3": "We think he may be able to give us the passcode that the Sith give their informers to enter the base.",
      "nm26acrepd07070_.mp3": "He has proved most resilient so far...",
      "nm26acrepd07072_.mp3": "Good. It's a logical place to start. But you should also hear about the other options available to you.",
      "nm26acrepd07074_.mp3": "We managed to pick up a crate of blank Sith data cards the type they use for passcards.",
      "nm26acrepd07075_.mp3": "The encryption system to unlock them is very difficult however, but if you are more skilled than our technicians, you may be able to gain access that way.",
      "nm26acrepd07077_.mp3": "Good. It is a very intelligent and skilled individual who can crack the matrices of a Sith encryption system.",
      "nm26acrepd07078_.mp3": "But there is one last method you should know about in case all other options fail.",
      "nm26acrepd07080_.mp3": "The Sith have got the Selkath to give them exclusive use of one of the main hangar bays.",
      "nm26acrepd07081_.mp3": "Visiting Sith masters use this bay to land, then take a speeder over the water to an external entrance to the Sith enclave.",
      "nm26acrepd07082_.mp3": "The luckless spy we mentioned earlier had a passcard to that hangar on him. While it is surely well guarded, it may prove to be the most direct route. Here is the card.",
      "nm26acrepd07083_.mp3": "The Sith base itself is very heavily guarded. If they became aware of your presence, I fear you would be quickly outnumbered and killed.",
      "nm26acrepd07084_.mp3": "Here is a passcard to get you inside our facility. You should find all you need to get started in there.",
      "nm26acrepd07085_.mp3": "You can choose whichever of the methods you want as long as you get in the base and get the data recording back. Which method do you think you would like to try first?",
      "nm26acrepd07087_.mp3": "Good call, just make sure you don't push him too hard or we might lose him.",
      "nm26acrepd07088_.mp3": "I wish you luck in your task. Should you retrieve the data recording from the droid, return it here to me and we can see about getting you that information.",
      "nm26acrepd07090_.mp3": "Good choice. We've been working at that for a while, but it's been too difficult so far. Maybe you'll have better luck.",
      "nm26acrepd07092_.mp3": "You'll need luck for that one - odds are they have some pretty strong guards in there. But it's also the way most likely to succeed.",
      "nm26acrepd07094_.mp3": "Very well.",
      "nm26acrepd07096_.mp3": "There is no need to be so rude.",
      "nm26acrepd07097_.mp3": "Have you managed to retrieve the data from our droid in the Sith base?",
      "nm26acrepd07099_.mp3": "Excellent! It does not appear to have been tampered with, so the Sith did not manage to copy its contents yet.",
      "nm26acrepd07100_.mp3": "And now for your information... We are not supposed to speak of this, but since you are a Jedi, and we have exhausted all the other options, I think I can entrust you with this.",
      "nm26acrepd07101_.mp3": "As you know, the Republic is fighting for its very existence against the evil of the Sith Empire. As you also undoubtedly know, we are doing very poorly.",
      "nm26acrepd07102_.mp3": "We need much in the way of supplies and material to stem the tide of battle and bring us victory.",
      "nm26acrepd07103_.mp3": "Manaan is the sole source of kolto, the most powerful medical substance in the galaxy. Frankly, we need as much of it as we can get.",
      "nm26acrepd07105_.mp3": "The Selkath conservatives with their neutrality treaties seek to treat the Sith and the Republic equally. This includes kolto exports.",
      "nm26acrepd07106_.mp3": "But a few more far-sighted Selkath see that if the Sith are ever allowed to win, the galaxy will be plunged into darkness and there would be nothing to stop them from taking Manaan anyway.",
      "nm26acrepd07107_.mp3": "So we made a deal...",
      "nm26acrepd07109_.mp3": "We recently began construction of a secret underground facility to harvest kolto directly at its source. We also hope to one day be able to synthesize it effectively.",
      "nm26acrepd07110_.mp3": "Current techniques are insufficient for the task, so we must mine it for now. The amount we take would hardly be noticed, since most is lost naturally before it reaches the surface anyway.",
      "nm26acrepd07111_.mp3": "We were nearing completion of the base when the digging teams reported some sort of obstruction... an ancient building or artifact. Possibly your 'Star Map'.",
      "nm26acrepd07112_.mp3": "Transmissions from the base were cut off abruptly after that, and we haven't heard from the station since.",
      "nm26acrepd07114_.mp3": "As you may have noticed, we are hiring a lot of mercenaries around here. Ostensibly they're to be shipped off-world to aid in our fight against the Sith, but they are really for another purpose.",
      "nm26acrepd07115_.mp3": "When we lost contact with the station in the Hrakert Rift, we sent our contingent of Republic soldiers down to investigate. None returned...",
      "nm26acrepd07116_.mp3": "We have tried hiring mercenaries and sending them down as well, but none of those expeditions have returned either.",
      "nm26acrepd07117_.mp3": "The reason we really sent that droid underwater - and the reason we needed its data back so badly - was to find out what had happened to the Hrakert Rift station.",
      "nm26acrepd07118_.mp3": "But now that we have the data back, our operation is in no danger of exposure to the Sith. And now I must live up to my end of the bargain.",
      "nm26acrepd07120_.mp3": "I took the liberty of having a submarine prepared for your departure. Merely use this card to get past the door behind our kolto packing room and enter the sub therein.",
      "nm26acrepd07121_.mp3": "It has been programmed to take you down to the station, and also to take you back up should you need something.",
      "nm26acrepd07122_.mp3": "I would send soldiers to assist you, but we have lost many of ours, and nearly exhausted the mercenary population of this planet. The soldiers we have are barely enough to keep this base secure!",
      "nm26acrepd07123_.mp3": "The Sith have also noted our interest and begun to bribe mercenaries away from us...",
      "nm26acrepd07124_.mp3": "Please, find out what happened to the facility. There may be some survivors left down there, perhaps even the head scientist - Kono Nolan.",
      "nm26acrepd07125_.mp3": "Good luck in your efforts.",
      "nm26acrepd07128_.mp3": "*Sigh* We don't know. We just don't know.",
      "nm26acrepd07130_.mp3": "Please, just let me explain.",
      "nm26acrepd07132_.mp3": "Shhh! Not so loud! Yes, it is a technical violation of the treaty, but it is sanctioned by elements of the Selkath government. We need only keep it hidden from the Sith.",
      "nm26acrepd07134_.mp3": "I know... but to the senators, it seemed to outweigh the risks.",
      "nm26acrepd07137_.mp3": "Time is a critical factor. We cannot allow the Sith to decode that data recording or our operations on Manaan would be compromised.",
      "nm26acrepd08000_.mp3": "You have returned! I was beginning to fear that you, too, might have been lost. Did you find out what had happened down there at the facility?",
      "nm26acrepd08002_.mp3": "Insane? What did they do? And why?",
      "nm26acrepd08004_.mp3": "They killed... everyone? And the mercenaries we sent later? That is... horrible. What caused them to all go insane at once like that?",
      "nm26acrepd08006_.mp3": "Something was down there? Living in the Rift by the kolto?",
      "nm26acrepd08008_.mp3": "That's... horrible. The entire operation wasted by a disaster we could never in a thousand years have foreseen.",
      "nm26acrepd08010_.mp3": "What has happened to the facility itself? Were there any survivors?",
      "nm26acrepd08012_.mp3": "Well, that is good to know. Good to know indeed. But... What has happened to the facility? Was it damaged?",
      "nm26acrepd08014_.mp3": "No! That is terrible. That will set our work back years... *sigh* It may even cost us the war.",
      "nm26acrepd08016_.mp3": "While I am glad that you were able to solve our problems, the cost may have ended up being much too high.",
      "nm26acrepd08018_.mp3": "But you have done your job and helped us in our time of need, and for that I thank you.",
      "nm26acrepd08020_.mp3": "Oh, and did you end up finding your Star Map?",
      "nm26acrepd08022_.mp3": "As you can see, by helping us you helped yourself. Perhaps we can work together again in the future.",
      "nm26acrepd08025_.mp3": "I'll assume that means yes. As you can see, by helping us you helped yourself. Perhaps we can work together in the future.",
      "nm26acrepd08028_.mp3": "Contaminated? That's... That's much worse than I would ever have thought possible. It might have been better to lose the entire facility rather than damage the kolto supply.",
      "nm26acrepd08030_.mp3": "This must remain entirely secret. We cannot allow anyone to find out that we damaged the kolto production or we would be banned permanently from the planet.",
      "nm26acrepd08032_.mp3": "We can only hope that the damage that was caused will go away in time.",

      "nm33aaczer07001_.mp3": "Greetings. You've heard of that awful business on Edean, yes? Our corporate outpost there has been destroyed by the Wookiee savages.",
      "nm33aaczer07002_.mp3": "This could put back the use of Wookiee labor considerably. We may even have to abandon the planet completely.",
      "nm33aaczer07004_.mp3": "I see you got one of your own early. May as well, while you can. Now then... was there something I could do for you?",
      "nm33aaczer07006_.mp3": "Well, certainly. Now they are doomed to remain savages forever... or possibly become extinct. Very sad. Now then... was there something you needed?",
      "nm33aaczer07007_.mp3": "Ah, well. What can you do? Sorry... was there something you needed?",
      "nm33aaczer07008_.mp3": "If you've come for any medical supplies, I have to warn you that the kolto source on Manaan has been poisoned.",
      "nm33aaczer07009_.mp3": "It's a tragedy, considering the war and all... casualties are going to go through the roof. Czerka is pulling all its kolto out of storage as we speak.",
      "nm33aaczer07010_.mp3": "Hmm. Aren't you the human who won the swoop race on Manaan? Congradulations and well done! It was most exciting to watch!",
      "nm33aaczer07011_.mp3": "It is an honor to have you in our offices. How may Czerka serve you?",
      "nm33aaczer07012_.mp3": "Tsk. I suppose you've heard about the destruction of Taris, yes? Awful business, that. Czerka lost a fortune there, not that the Sith care.",
      "nm33aaczer07013_.mp3": "I understand you're receiving training at the monastery, citizen. Congratulations!",
      "nm33aaczer07014_.mp3": "Greetings again, citizen. Something you need?",
      "nm33aaczer07015_.mp3": "Greetings and welcome to Czerka Corporation.",

      "nm33aaczer07018_.mp3": "Our starport is mostly just freighters and such, but we do get many travelers that come here to learn from the Sith.",

      "nm03aehold13059_.mp3": "What? I can't do that! Think how it would look. I work for Davik, I've got a certain reputation to uphold. I can't let her get away with this. There has to be payback!",
      "nm03aehold13061_.mp3": "Although I do feel a little guilty about all this. Dia's a good looking gal - it'd be a shame to kill her. Tell you what - I'll take 200 credits in exchange for lifting the bounty.",
      "nm03aehold13063_.mp3": "Don't worry - I'll stick to my end of the bargain. I'll go tell Zax right now that the bounty is off the table.",
      "nm03aehold13066_.mp3": "[Success] Well... I guess you might be right. Besides, I've noticed some of the girls around here are giving me the cold shoulder since all this started. Okay, you win; Dia can live.",

      "nm17af07ga03001_.mp3": "Well now, what can Gandroff do for you? It's been a while since I've had anyone bother talking to me.",
      "nm17af07ga03003_.mp3": "I saw you down by the track, didn't I? Or was that someone else? I've been distracted by what happened on Taris.",
      "nm17af07ga03004_.mp3": "Usually it's some kid wondering what my old racing days were like... but that was back on Taris. Seems like a long time ago.",
      "nm17af07ga03006_.mp3": "I'm not sure what I have that you would be interested in. I... I'm... I'm just an old swoop-jock that doesn't have the head for it anymore. Heh.",
      "nm17af07ga03008_.mp3": "I... I am not used to such attention. Uh, what do you want me to repeat?",
      "nm17af07ga03009_.mp3": "Ahh, something I know. Well... well, something I used to know. Um, my racing days are behind me. Gandroff is the name.",
      "nm17af07ga03011_.mp3": "Best place to race is wherever the track treats you sweet and your times are golden. It's that simple.",
      "nm17af07ga03013_.mp3": "You get hung up on any one track and... and you'll end up like me. Heh heh. My favorite stop was Taris... Taris, yes... always looked forward to going back.",
      "nm17af07ga03015_.mp3": "Now I don't want to touch my bike at all. Maybe I wasn't in the winner's circle lately, but I still raced for sport, you know? Vroom vroom.",
      "nm17af07ga03017_.mp3": "Oh, I... I don't want to get into that, miss. Let's just say that there was always someone trackside rooting for me. Heh heh.",
      "nm17af07ga03019_.mp3": "A woman. I never won on Taris, but it was always my first stop on the circuit, and the last if I could help it. Heh.",
      "nm17af07ga03021_.mp3": "That doesn't matter now. You can't ask for more certain closure than the whole planet being gone. Poof. Boom. Heh. Gone.",
      "nm17af07ga03023_.mp3": "Oh, well past my prime, by any measure. I started late, too. Not like the kids out there now. Some of them are too young. Hm.",
      "nm17af07ga03025_.mp3": "It's a cutthroat business. I... I've seen some of them burn out after a year. They get dangerous, and don't live long.",
      "nm17af07ga03027_.mp3": "That's not everyone, of course, but... but it happens. I'm a has-been, I'll admit, but... but dying while you're on top is still dying. I'll pass.",
      "nm17af07ga03029_.mp3": "I don't really talk to any of them. I know Zoriis from the circuit and you couldn't ask for a tougher lady. Smart too.",
      "nm17af07ga03031_.mp3": "I don't know the younger guys, but... but I've been watching Nico. Uh, good to see someone doing it for the love of the race.",
      "nm17af07ga03033_.mp3": "I don't know, but some people just have something that lets the bike take them. It's like the air stops pushing back.",
      "nm17af07ga03035_.mp3": "I think you know what I mean; when the wind decides to stop fighting? Hmm. You've felt it. I can tell by your times.",
      "nm17af07ga03036_.mp3": "That's an old track tale, you know; when the wind decides to stop fighting? I used to have that. Heh... not any more.",
      "nm17af07ga03037_.mp3": "I don't know the younger guys, but I suppose they're in good hands. What you did for Nico was good to see.",
      "nm17af07ga03038_.mp3": "I don't know the younger guys, but after you pushed that deal on Nico, I doubt they'd trust me or anyone. ",
      "nm17af07ga03040_.mp3": "All right then. ",
      "nm17af07ga03043_.mp3": "Ask me again in a few years and it will be me. Heh heh. I'm probably not going back out on the circuit... if there is one.",
      "nm17af07ga03045_.mp3": "But, for now, I don't know any more than the next guy. You should try the locals. Jawas maybe. Funny little guys. Li'l jawa, li'l jawa.",
      "nm17af07ga03047_.mp3": "Uh, keep safe. Yup. Yup. Seems like tough times are coming.",
      "nm17af07ga03048_.mp3": "Sure, not a problem. Might as well try to pass along some of what I know. Heh heh. My racing days are pretty much done.",
      "nm17af07ga03050_.mp3": "Uh, well, I wouldn't worry about that, not with your attitude. Go on then, ask away. I'm ready.",
      "nm17af07ga03052_.mp3": "No need to get all confrontational. What are... what are we, Sand People? You wouldn't find much fight left in me, anyway. ",
      "nm17af07ga03054_.mp3": "Then race for it! By the Force, what do you think an old man like me would have? Bah, take it all.",
      "nm17af07ga03057_.mp3": "Why bother? I mean, will this pay for ship maintenance or whatever? You're just looking for coward credits.",
      "nm17af07ga03059_.mp3": "Bah, if it will get you to leave, just take what credits I have. Take em. Take em. Now leave me. I don't want anything to do with you.",
      "nm17af07ga03061_.mp3": "Doesn't seem like it. I've seen your kind before. Does it make you feel big, pushing old men around? You're all the same. Heh.",
      "nm17af07ga03063_.mp3": "Now, leave me to my drinking. I don't think we'd have much to talk about. Not if I can help it.",
      "nm17af07ga03064_.mp3": "I hear you're pretty good on the track. Yeah. I remember my first paycheck for racing. Heh heh. So small you couldn't see it, but I remember.",
      "nm17af07ga03065_.mp3": "Hello again. I hear you're pretty fast out on the track. Remember these days. Yes sir. Once they're gone, whoo, they're gone.",
      "nm17af07ga03066_.mp3": "I heard about you setting a track record. Wish I'd seen it. Ah, it would've just made me want to be out there myself.",

      "nm04aaruki25017_.mp3": "You may not think these are fables after you see what I have brought you, Gendar! Look at these journals!",
      "nm04aaruki25021_.mp3": "I swear to you everything in these journals is true, Gendar. The Promised Land - I told you I would find it!",
      "nm04aaruki25025_.mp3": "I do not deny the journey will be hard, Gendar. But surely it is better than the miserable life we have here!",
      "nm04aaruki25029_.mp3": "Thank you once again, up-worlder. I will say a final goodbye, for where we are going I fear you cannot come. The journey to the Promised Land is long and arduous.",
      "nm04aaruki25031_.mp3": "We must part ways here, up-worlder. I sense your destiny is yet to be chosen, but the destiny of my people is at the end of the long journey ahead of us.",
      "nm04aaruki25034_.mp3": "No, up-worlder, I cannot ask that. The journey will take many, many weeks. And those who make the journey cannot return - that was the final secret of the Promised Land.",
      "nm04aaruki25036_.mp3": "When the colony was created it was designed so that people could enter willingly, but they could never leave again. This was to ensure secrecy on the project.",
      "nm04aaruki25040_.mp3": "Yes, up-worlder... well done. However, I see that this journal alone does not have enough clues for me to solve this mystery. Too many pieces are still missing.",
      "nm04aaruki25042_.mp3": "I'm afraid that only with all three journals - my grandfather's, my father's and my apprentice's - will I be able to discover the location of the Promised Land.",
      "nm04aaruki25044_.mp3": "I will leave this journal with you for safe keeping for now. Perhaps it will aid you in your search for the others. I wish you luck, up-worlder - for the sake of the entire village.",
      "nm04aaruki25047_.mp3": "You - you come from the world above! Is this the time of destiny, then? Is this a portent of the salvation of my people? Or merely another false sign to mislead us from the path?",
      "nm04aaruki25049_.mp3": "Are you the herald of prophecy? The beacon to guide us through the darkness? Or are you merely another harbinger of shattered dreams and unfulfilled promises?",
      "nm04aaruki25057_.mp3": "Speak to me, up-worlder! Tell me what fate you unleash upon us - salvation or damnation! Speak, up-worlder - I beg you!",
      "nm04aaruki25059_.mp3": "A question. You are uncertain. Bewildered. Perplexed. Understandable, I suppose. Even after a hundred years of life I myself still become confused at times.",
      "nm04aaruki25063_.mp3": "Old, yes. But not insane. Oh no, not insane at all! I am as rational as any man can be after a hundred years in the filth and darkness of the Undercity!",
      "nm04aaruki25065_.mp3": "Perhaps I can make things more clear. Some things, at least. My name is Rukil, the oldest Outcast here in the village. Rukil Wrinkle-Skin, the children call me sometimes.",
      "nm04aaruki25067_.mp3": "Once I was honored for my wisdom, but over time the villagers fell away from the true path. Eventually there was only a single apprentice who followed me - and now she is gone, too.",
      "nm04aaruki25069_.mp3": "No, no, no. Not yet. I must be wary. Careful. You may be a false savior. Dare I share my secrets with you? No... not until you prove yourself.",
      "nm04aaruki25072_.mp3": "My apprentice is... lost. I sent her out into the Undercity to find... well, I cannot tell you. Not yet. Sadly, my apprentice has not returned.",
      "nm04aaruki25074_.mp3": "Please, up-worlder - will you help an old man? Will you seek out my apprentice in the Undercity? Her name is Malya. I must know of her fate, whatever it may be. I must know what she... found.",
      "nm04aaruki25076_.mp3": "Finding her may be difficult; Malya could be anywhere in the Undercity... but if you find her I will know you to be our true savior! Only then can I reveal my secret knowledge to you.",
      "nm04aaruki25078_.mp3": "I wish you luck, up-worlder. Come speak to me again once you have discovered the fate of my apprentice.",
      "nm04aaruki25081_.mp3": "Then... perhaps you are not the one I have been waiting for. Should you change your mind, up-worlder, speak with me again. Come to me if you learn the fate of my apprentice.",
      "nm04aaruki25086_.mp3": "Please, a moment up-worlder. I must know if you are the one I have been waiting for. Please, I beg for your help.",
      "nm04aaruki25089_.mp3": "Greetings once more, up-worlder. Do you bring news of my apprentice? Have you discovered her fate, and proved yourself to be a true savior of my people?",
      "nm04aaruki25091_.mp3": "It is as I feared, then. She joins the list of those who have given their lives in the service of our cause. But though I am saddened by this news, there is yet hope.",
      "nm04aaruki25093_.mp3": "By finding my apprentice you have proved yourself worthy, up-worlder. You are to be the beacon on our path to salvation. You will guide us to the Promised Land!",
      "nm04aaruki25097_.mp3": "You are marked, up-worlder - even my dim old eyes can see the mantle of destiny that cloaks you. Perhaps old Rukil knows you better than you know yourself.",
      "nm04aaruki25099_.mp3": "I am old - I have lived a hundred years in the Undercity, cast down into the darkness. I know the legends and history of our people - and now you must learn it, too.",
      "nm04aaruki25101_.mp3": "The great city of Taris covers the entire surface of this planet. There is no land to grow food. Kelp harvests and the creatures of the sea are our only food source.",
      "nm04aaruki25103_.mp3": "A century ago rising levels of toxic pollution poisoned the oceans and famine swept the planet. The rich hoarded food for their own use, and the poor were left to starve and die.",
      "nm04aaruki25105_.mp3": "But the poor rose up against this tyranny and civil war engulfed the planet. Millions died in the fighting and huge sections of Taris were destroyed or abandoned. ",
      "nm04aaruki25107_.mp3": "The rebellion was crushed in the end, thousands were taken prisoner. The jails could not hold them all, and so the practice of banishing all prisoners to the Undercity was born.",
      "nm04aaruki25109_.mp3": "Many brave men and women were banished here to the Undercity for their part in the rebellion. People like my father and grandfather were cast down, along with their families.",
      "nm04aaruki25113_.mp3": "Now we live a dark existence beneath the streets of Taris, a life devoid of all hope but one: the Promised Land. And you will be the one to show us the way to get there.",
      "nm04aaruki25115_.mp3": "Legends tell of a self-sufficient colony founded just before the famine and lost during the civil war; a paradise beneath the Undercity where droid servants tend to every need.",
      "nm04aaruki25117_.mp3": "For many years I searched for the Promised Land, just as my grandfather and father did before me. When I became old and gray my apprentice continued the search on my behalf.",
      "nm04aaruki25119_.mp3": "I have collected many clues hinting at its location; the journal of my apprentice provides yet more information. But still there are too many pieces missing from this puzzle.",
      "nm04aaruki25121_.mp3": "But I know my father and grandfather each had journals where they recorded their own discoveries. Perhaps with their journals I could at last uncover its hidden location.",
      "nm04aaruki25124_.mp3": "I have nothing to offer if you help me in this. I hope the knowledge that you are helping the entire village escape a life of darkness and suffering is reward enough.",
      "nm04aaruki25126_.mp3": "It is many decades since my father set out on his journey, but I remember he was eager to explore the sewers. You might want to begin your search there.",
      "nm04aaruki25128_.mp3": "I wish you luck in your quest, up-worlder. The future survival of this village - of my people - depends on you.",
      "nm04aaruki25132_.mp3": "Please, up-worlder - I am too old to search for the missing journals myself, and the other villagers think the Promised Land is nothing but a myth. ",
      "nm04aaruki25134_.mp3": "I see. Well, perhaps you are not the savior I seek after all. I can only pray that if you find the journals you will have a change of heart and bring them to me.",
      "nm04aaruki25141_.mp3": "I offer you wisdom and you turn me away? Perhaps you are not ready to accept the role you must play in the destiny and salvaton of my people.",
      "nm04aaruki25143_.mp3": "Very well, up-worlder. Return to me when you are ready to learn what you must learn.",
      "nm04aaruki25146_.mp3": "You seek my wisdom, but I dare not share my knowledge with you. Not yet. Not until you prove yourself to be the one foretold, the one who will guide us to salvation.",
      "nm04aaruki25148_.mp3": "Find my apprentice. Discover what fate has befallen her and I will know you are worthy, and not another false prophet sent to mislead my people!",

      "nm14aasett11040_.mp3": "Hm... the ones you'll most likely hear about are the Sandrals and Matales. Big, wealthy land-owners, both of them.",

      "nm14aasett11043_.mp3": "Well... from what I hear it started about a week ago. See, Nurik's son Casus is an archeologist, bright lad too, but he disappeared. Nurik of course blamed Ahlan, but even he didn't take it before the Council.",
      "nm14aasett11044_.mp3": "But now Ahlan's son Shen has disappeared as well... and no one knows where he's gone. Ahlan blames Nurik. He thinks he's kidnapped his son.",

      "nm36aasith06009_.mp3": "Oh, this is quite interesting. My mentor told me that Sith apparitions might be possible, but I never truly believed it!",
      "nm36aasith06011_.mp3": "Thank you for the information! I must go and inform my mentor at once of this strange news!",
      "nm36aasith06013_.mp3": "Oh? Well, that is quite disappointing. From what I remember of the old databases, that looks so similar it's startling.",

      "nm36aasith06023_.mp3": "These ruins date back to a period when the Sith were first formed, before their exile into the far reaches of space. It's quite fascinating.",
      "nm36aasith06025_.mp3": "I've been working on a translation of some of the runes by this tomb. I'm quite excited... this may very well be the tomb of Ajunta Pall.",

      "nm36aasith06033_.mp3": "The runes say that he was interred here, so I think it may indeed be possible. Whoever found the sword could gain great prestige.",
      "nm36aasith06035_.mp3": "A... few of the bolder students have tried. They did not return. As I understand it, the tombs are quite dangerous.",
      "nm36aasith06037_.mp3": "From what I've been told, the tombs have old traps and machines that are still active. They were designed to keep out intruders when they were made and still do.",

      "nm36aasith06041_.mp3": "Oh, these tombs are certainly not harmless. Don't think that. The sword may be tempting, but I'm not about to risk my life to find it.",
      "nm36aasith06043_.mp3": "N-no. I want power as much as the next person, but I'm not stupid. I know what I'm capable of.",
      "nm36aasith06045_.mp3": "Certainly. Finding such an artifact and giving it to Master Uthar would earn anyone big points. Although I suppose you could also keep it...",
      "nm36aasith06047_.mp3": "Nothing at all. The legends don't say anything about it... it may have had powers only for Ajunta alone.",

      "nm02acgurn03006_.mp3": "I'm glad you took that serum down to Zax - I got a nice little finder's fee for helping Davik get his hands on the rakghoul cure. He gave me more than Zelka pays in a month!",

      "nm02acgurn03045_.mp3": "If you find the rakghoul serum, just take it to Zax in the Lower City bounty office. He works for Davik. He'll pay you what that cure is really worth!",

      "nm26aasunr26062_.mp3": "If I confess I'm looking at 20 years in prison! And the Ahto City officials might even place kolto sanctions on the Republic Embassy. Without kolto how can we treat the injuries to our soldiers on the front lines!",
      "nm26aasunr26064_.mp3": "No. I can't do that and put the Republic's supply of kolto in danger. No I won't! Now look, I may have done something stupid, and it may only be worse for my standing by it, but I will not confess.",
      "nm26aasunr26065_.mp3": "If you turn me in, the Republic will likely lose its kolto export privileges and then we'll lose the war for sure. Are you going to send all those thousands, millions - like on Taris - to their deaths, just for your sense of 'justice'?",

      "nm26aairim06022_.mp3": "The Sith sought to buy my loyalty with credits... as if wealth could somehow quench my burning bloodlust! They would have been better off hiring an Echani for the errands they had me running. ",
      "nm26aairim06024_.mp3": "The task paid well, but was boring and beneath me. I was told to lure the Selkath youth to the Sith Embassy, nothing more. I lied, I threatened, I promised... and I brought the most promising youth of the fish people to the Sith.",
      "nm26aairim06026_.mp3": "And there I left them. To what purpose I neither know, nor care. Perhaps when the Sith learn I have betrayed their secret they will try to kill me. I would welcome the excitement.",

      "nm26aairim06032_.mp3": "On my world those too weak to defend themselves deserve to die. A murder is justified if you have the strength to kill your victim. Is there anything else you would know?",

      "nm26aairim06036_.mp3": "They lack the resolve to do what needs to be done. The Echani believe in a non-existent warrior code of honor, and the Mandalorians prize credits above bloodshed.",
      "nm26aairim06037_.mp3": "But I am Iridorian. Honor comes from slaying your opponent, and the true reward of any job is the taste of your foe's dying blood on your tongue.",

      "nm13aadora08043_.mp3": "The Mandalorian Wars, the fall of Revan and Malak, the rise of the Sith: there are important lessons to be learned from these events if we do not wish to repeat the mistakes of our past.",
      "nm13aadora08045_.mp3": "Of course I could not tell you the entire history of our Order; the Jedi have existed for thousands upon thousands of years. We are as old as the Republic itself.",
      "nm13aadora08046_.mp3": "Instead, I will begin forty years ago with the war of Exar Kun. Like Malak and Revan, Exar Kun was a Jedi who fell to the dark side and led an army against the Jedi and the Republic.",
      "nm13aadora08047_.mp3": "Exar Kun was defeated, but the war left both the Republic and our own Order severely weakened. For twenty years we struggled to rebuild, trying to erase the scars of the terrible conflict.",
      "nm13aadora08049_.mp3": "All things in time. You shall learn that history is an intricate weaving of many events. No one thing can be understood without the proper context.",
      "nm13aadora08051_.mp3": "Twenty years ago the Mandalorians, aware the Republic was in a weakened state, began conquering small worlds on the Outer Rim. They were careful to choose only planets outside the Republic's jurisdiction.",
      "nm13aadora08052_.mp3": "After much debate, the Senate chose not to intervene. As long as the Mandalorians avoided planets that were members of the Republic itself, there would be no retaliation.",
      "nm13aadora08054_.mp3": "Well, you can hardly blame the Republic. The memory of war was fresh in everyone's mind, nobody was eager to relive the horrors in a campaign against the Mandalorians. But in the end it was unavoidable.",
      "nm13aadora08057_.mp3": "The Mandalorians stockpiled resources from their conquered worlds, preparing for a massive assault. Seven years ago they launched a simultaneous attack in three separate sectors of Republic space.",
      "nm13aadora08058_.mp3": "The Senate had no choice but to retaliate with the entire Republic fleet. The Mandalorian Wars had begun.",
      "nm13aadora08060_.mp3": "The Republic petitioned the Jedi Council for aid, but there were many factors to consider before we allowed ourselves to be drawn into another conflict so soon after the war with Exar Kun.",
      "nm13aadora08061_.mp3": "While the Jedi Council preached patience, there were many among our Order who were eager for us to join the battle. Two young Knights in particular demanded immediate action: Revan and Malak.",
      "nm13aadora08062_.mp3": "They rallied many of the Jedi to their cause and, against the wishes of their Masters, joined the Republic fleet battling the Mandalorians.",
      "nm13aadora08063_.mp3": "Revan was a brilliant military leader, and the Republic fleet began to win victory after victory. Four years ago the Mandalorians surrendered unconditionally.",
      "nm13aadora08065_.mp3": "No one is denying that Revan was one of the keys to defeating the Mandalorians... but something happened out there on the Outer Rim.",
      "nm13aadora08066_.mp3": "Instead of returning after the war's end, the ships under Revan's command went deep into unexplored space. They claimed to be searching for the last remnants of the Mandalorian fleet.",
      "nm13aadora08067_.mp3": "All contact was lost. For many months it was assumed some great disaster had befallen the entire fleet. Everyone thought they were dead.",
      "nm13aadora08068_.mp3": "There were unsubstantiated rumors of Revan and Malak being seen on a number of different planets during these months - scattered sightings that were never confirmed.",
      "nm13aadora08070_.mp3": "Perhaps they simply went far beyond the edges of Republic space. Maybe they found previously undiscovered hyperspace routes to the ends of the galaxy. Nobody knows for certain.",
      "nm13aadora08071_.mp3": "Three years ago, Revan and Malak returned at the head of a massive invasion fleet. Revan had assumed the title of Sith Lord; the hero had become a conqueror.",
      "nm13aadora08073_.mp3": "Some of the ships in the Sith fleet are those that were under Revan's command during the Mandalorian Wars. But many more are of an alien design we have never seen before.",
      "nm13aadora08074_.mp3": "The source of this massive fleet is one of the many things about the Sith we cannot explain. It seems impossible to have created it in such a short time, yet we cannot deny its existence.",
      "nm13aadora08075_.mp3": "The source of the Sith soldiers is, unfortunately, much easier to understand. Initially the bulk of the force were former Republic soldiers who had served under Revan.",
      "nm13aadora08076_.mp3": "With each conquest thousands more flocked to join the invaders, swelling their numbers. Even many of our own Order have betrayed us, lured by Sith promises of riches and power.",
      "nm13aadora08078_.mp3": "For two years the Sith were all but invincible. Fortunately, Bastila and her Battle Meditation allowed the Republic to win a few key victories and kept the Sith from total triumph.",
      "nm13aadora08079_.mp3": "In desperation we set a trap for the Dark Lord. Bastila was with the strike team that tried to capture Revan, as you probably know. She was there at Revan's end.",
      "nm13aadora08080_.mp3": "That was nearly a year ago, but things have not improved. Malak has stepped in and assumed the mantle of Dark Lord for himself, though he is far from Revan's equal in strategy or tactics.",
      "nm13aadora08081_.mp3": "Still, his fleet continues to grow in both ships and soldiers. If we do not find some way to stop the Sith soon, Malak will overwhelm us with sheer numbers.",
      "nm13aadora08083_.mp3": "Revan's tale shows us how even the greatest of Jedi can fall to the dark side. You must always be on guard against the evil that dwells within you. Think hard upon this lesson.",
      "nm13aadora08085_.mp3": "May the Force be with you.",
      "nm13aadora08087_.mp3": "Your confidence is admirable, but you must guard against pride and arrogance. These lead to the dark side.",
      "nm13aadora08091_.mp3": "Initially the bulk of the Sith force were former Republic soldiers who had served under Revan. With each conquest thousands more flocked to join the invaders, swelling their numbers.",
      "nm13aadora08092_.mp3": "Even many of our own Order have betrayed us, lured by Sith promises of riches and power. But what is more disturbing is the size of the Sith fleet itself.",
      "nm13aadora08093_.mp3": "Some of the ships in the Sith fleet are those that were under Revan's command during the Mandalorian Wars. But many more are of an alien design we have never seen before.",
      "nm13aadora08094_.mp3": "The source of this massive fleet is one of the many things about the Sith we cannot explain. It seems impossible to have created it in such a short time, yet we cannot deny its existence.",
      "nm13aadora08097_.mp3": "Revan and Malak were heroes, the great saviors of the Republic. A third of the Republic fleet was under their direct command... and then something happened.",
      "nm13aadora08103_.mp3": "All Jedi must know the code, its tenets are the fundamental teachings of our Order. Think and meditate on these truths, apprentice:",
      "nm13aadora08104_.mp3": "There is no emotion; there is peace. There is no ignorance; there is knowledge. There is no passion; there is serenity. There is no chaos; there is harmony. There is no death; there is the Force.",

      "nm13aadora08111_.mp3": "As you wish. I will not force you to hear what I have to say, though I think it is unwise to ignore the lessons of the past. Perhaps you can return when you have more time.",
      "nm13aadora08112_.mp3": "I bid you welcome once more. I assume you have come so that I might continue my recounting of the recent history of the Jedi Order.",
      "nm13aadora08114_.mp3": "It pleases me to see a student who understands the value of history. I shall resume where we last left off.",
      "nm13aadora08115_.mp3": "I have already told you of the war against Exar Kun and the damage it wrought upon the Republic and the Jedi Order. Even now we are still rebuilding from that terrible conflict.",
      "nm13aadora08116_.mp3": "When we last spoke I had just told you of the Mandalorian invasion of seven years ago. The Republic sent their entire fleet to do battle with this new threat.",
      "nm13aadora08117_.mp3": "I was telling you how Revan and Malak returned three years ago, at the head of a massive invasion fleet.",
      "nm13aadora08118_.mp3": "Greetings, young apprentice. Have you come seeking knowledge of the past? Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it, or so they say.",
      "nm13aadora08119_.mp3": "Greetings, young Padawan. Have you come seeking knowledge of the past? Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it, or so they say.",
      "nm13aadora08120_.mp3": "As Chronicler of the Academy here on Dantooine, I find your quest for knowledge admirable. But I do not want to overwhelm you with the long history of the Jedi Order.",
      "nm13aadora08121_.mp3": "You should ponder the history of Revan; it contains many lessons you may need if we hope to defeat Malak and the Sith.",

      "nglobebant00079_.mp3": "Don't worry, Big Z. It's nothing I can't fix. A little trim, a splash of coloring and you'll be as good as new. Best looking Wookiee on the planet. Maybe a nice suit...",
      "nglobebant00081_.mp3": "I know Wookiees aren't into the whole clothing thing, but you could start a whole new trend! You'd be on the cutting edge.",

      "nglobemiss13008_.mp3": "But I suppose that's why we need to stop Malak, right? The more time I spend dwelling on Taris the more chance some other planet will get wiped out. I guess that's what it comes down to.",

      "nglobemiss13010_.mp3": "Hey, there. What can I do for you?",
      "nglobemiss13012_.mp3": "Taris is a pretty good place to grow up, all things considered. Just stick to the area you belong in and stay out of Davik's business and you'll be fine.",
      "nglobemiss13014_.mp3": "The Upper City's got some nice shops and all, but it's boring! The only time I go up there is if I need free healing from Zelka at his medical facility.",
      "nglobemiss13016_.mp3": "What can I say? The Lower City was a great place to hang out until the Vulkars started that gang war. Now you can't even walk the streets without getting shot at!",
      "nglobemiss13018_.mp3": "It can be pretty nasty down there: you've got rakghouls crawling around looking for their next meal, and the Gamorrean slavers like to set up their bases in the sewers.",
      "nglobemiss13019_.mp3": "And then there's the Outcast village - a collection of people banished to the Undercity for their crimes. I mostly avoid the village, though; it's pretty depressing seeing how they live. ",
      "nglobemiss13021_.mp3": "I tend to keep my nose out of an intergalactic crime lord's business, you know? I can't tell you much that isn't common knowledge.",
      "nglobemiss13022_.mp3": "Extortion, slavery, smuggling: Davik's got a piece of all the action here on Taris. Even the swoop gangs know better than to get in his way.",
      "nglobemiss13024_.mp3": "Hey, no problem. I'm here to help, right?",
      "nglobemiss13025_.mp3": "I'm not the one you should ask about Dantooine. I didn't even know there was a Jedi Academy here; I always thought it was just a bunch of settlers and farmers! ",
      "nglobemiss13026_.mp3": "Sorry I can't be more help, you know? Is there anything else I can do for you?",
      "nglobemiss13027_.mp3": "Well, I know Zaalbar's from Kashyyyk, but he never liked to talk about it. He wouldn't even tell me why he left. I don't think the Wookiees like outsiders much. ",
      "nglobemiss13028_.mp3": "I don't know anything about Korriban, but I get a bad feeling in this place. If there's such a thing as an 'evil' planet, this is it!",
      "nglobemiss13029_.mp3": "I always heard Tatooine was nothing but a rock covered by a bunch of worthless sand. I can't even figure out why Czerka Corp. set up their mining operations here.",
      "nglobemiss13030_.mp3": "Manaan's the source for all the kolto in the galaxy; that's why those fish-faced Selkath can stay neutral in this whole Sith-Republic war. But I don't know much else about this place.",
      "nglobemiss13031_.mp3": "How am I supposed to know anything about this planet? It's an uncharted world in an unexplored quadrant! I didn't even know this planet was here!",
      "nglobemiss13032_.mp3": "Didn't you come here back when you were the Dark Lord? If you don't remember anything about this place then I guess we're just stumbling in the dark.",
      "nglobemiss13034_.mp3": "Want to practice your skills, eh? Sure - I'll play you a few hands. Just for practice, though. I don't want to bet with you.",
      "nglobemiss13036_.mp3": "No problem. Just so happens I've got one here I've been working on. Here you go... I'll just add it to our inventory.",
      "nglobemiss13037_.mp3": "Anything else you need?",
      "nglobemiss13038_.mp3": "Sorry, I don't have one handy right now. Besides, we've got plenty of security spikes already. Not much point in overloading on them, is there?",
      "nglobemiss13040_.mp3": "Really? You want to know about me? Nobody's ever really been interested in me before. What did you want to know?",
      "nglobemiss13043_.mp3": "Big Z's my family, you know? My parents... well, I guess they're dead. It was just me on my own until the day I saw Zaalbar in the Lower City. I could tell right away he was in trouble.",
      "nglobemiss13044_.mp3": "This was before the gang wars were out of hand, but even then the Vulkars were scum. A few of them were hassling Big Z, trying to pick a fight - but he wasn't looking for trouble. ",
      "nglobemiss13046_.mp3": "Hey, nobody said the Vulkars was smart. But there were three of them, so maybe they figured they could handle him. I don't know.",
      "nglobemiss13048_.mp3": "Anyway, I don't like Vulkars at the best of times. And when I saw them picking on this poor Wookiee - all alone on a strange planet, overwhelmed by the big city - I just lost it.",
      "nglobemiss13049_.mp3": "I screamed out 'Leave him alone, you core-slimes!' and charged right at them. One of them saw me coming and slapped me so hard he just about knocked me cold.",
      "nglobemiss13051_.mp3": "Hey, I don't need a lecture from you. You ain't my mother! I knew what I was doing.",
      "nglobemiss13053_.mp3": "Hey - don't treat me like I'm a little girl! I ain't no kid - I'm fourteen years old!",
      "nglobemiss13054_.mp3": "Those Vulkars didn't scare me. They're nothing but cowards. I knew how to deal with them. Of course, I never got the chance.",
      "nglobemiss13055_.mp3": "I guess Zaalbar didn't like seeing me get smacked around. He let out this howl and yanked that Vulkar a meter up off the ground and held him there by his throat. ",
      "nglobemiss13057_.mp3": "The other two screamed and ran off. Can't say I blame them. The first time you see an angry Wookiee up close it isn't a pretty sight.",
      "nglobemiss13058_.mp3": "I thought Zaalbar was going to rip that punk's arms off and beat him to death with his own fists. The Vulkar was so scared he fainted. Or maybe Big Z's breath just knocked him out.",
      "nglobemiss13060_.mp3": "Sorry Zaalbar, but I keep telling you to brush those choppers once in a while. Why do you think I won't stand downwind when you're talking?",
      "nglobemiss13061_.mp3": "I keep telling Zaalbar to brush those choppers of his, but he never listens. Just stay upwind when he's speaking and you'll be fine.",
      "nglobemiss13062_.mp3": "Anyway, I knew those Vulkars would be back with friends, so I grabbed Zaalbar and we took off. Ever since then we've been a team. We look out for each other, you know? ",
      "nglobemiss13064_.mp3": "He was fleeing some kind of trouble back on Kashyyyk. That's all I know, really. Big Z doesn't like to talk about it. In case you didn't notice he's the strong, silent type.",
      "nglobemiss13065_.mp3": "Doesn't much matter to me, though. I accept him for what he is, not what he was. Me and Zaalbar like to live in the present.",
      "nglobemiss13067_.mp3": "What's that supposed to mean? You think I can't take care of myself? I've got street smarts! I know how to get by on my own! ",
      "nglobemiss13068_.mp3": "In fact, I look out for Zaalbar more than he looks out for me, you know? Big Z's a little bit too gullible to make it alone on the mean streets of the Lower City.",
      "nglobemiss13070_.mp3": "Yeah, I suppose you're right. Like I used to tell my brother, fast talk and slick words don't get the job done.",
      "nglobemiss13072_.mp3": "Are you kidding? Big Z ain't like that! He's just a big old softie inside. Of course, the Vulkars didn't know that.",
      "nglobemiss13075_.mp3": "Fine - I won't tell how Zaalbar and I hooked up. Sheesh! First you ask about it, then you say you don't want to hear it! You're as bad as my brother used to be!",
      "nglobemiss13077_.mp3": "My brother's a touchy subject, you know? It just so happens I don't really feel like talking about him right now. Nothing personal. Let's just get back to the business at hand, okay?",
      "nglobemiss13080_.mp3": "Shouldn't we be more worried about getting Zaalbar back from those Wookiees? I don't trust that Chuundar character.",
      "nglobemiss13081_.mp3": "I... I was a little snappish when we last talked. I'm sorry about that. I get a little touchy when it comes to Griff. It's kind of embarassing telling people about him.",
      "nglobemiss13083_.mp3": "It's complicated. Griff wasn't the most popular guy, he had his faults. But I still loved him, you know? Sometimes people don't understand.",
      "nglobemiss13084_.mp3": "I never knew my parents, my brother always looked out for me. He's the one who brought me to Taris. I was just a kid, only five. But I remember the trip - if you could call it that.",
      "nglobemiss13085_.mp3": "We were stuffed inside a packing crate in a star freighter's cargo hold with just enough food and water to make the trip. Not exactly first class, you know?",
      "nglobemiss13087_.mp3": "I don't know the whole story - I was pretty young. But my brother owed a lot of money. Might even have been a few arrest warrants out for him, I don't know.",
      "nglobemiss13088_.mp3": "The only way to get off the planet was to smuggle ourselves out. I mean, I don't want to make it sound like we were criminals... well, maybe my brother was.",
      "nglobemiss13089_.mp3": "See, this is why I don't like to talk about it. It makes Griff sound worse than he really was. My brother had his problems, but he always looked out for me.",
      "nglobemiss13091_.mp3": "Yeah - that's what I'm trying to say! Without my brother I don't know where I'd be.",
      "nglobemiss13093_.mp3": "He gambled. And drank. And he was always borrowing money for his latest get rich quick scheme. But he had a good heart, you know? He taught me how to survive.",
      "nglobemiss13094_.mp3": "He showed me how to slice into a computer's security system; how to get inside a locked building without the entrance codes, and how to spot a wealthy mark for a quick shell game.",
      "nglobemiss13096_.mp3": "Hey, you don't know what it's like! You need those skills here in the Lower City. Griff did right by me.",
      "nglobemiss13097_.mp3": "I really miss him since he left. I keep hoping he'll come back some day. He promised me he would.",
      "nglobemiss13099_.mp3": "He fell in with a bad crowd. It's all Lena's fault. She's the one who took him from me! Just batted those long lashes at him and off he went!",
      "nglobemiss13101_.mp3": "I don't want to talk about Griff and Lena - just the thought of that space tramp makes my blood boil! Subject's closed as far as I'm concerned!",
      "nglobemiss13102_.mp3": "If I'm going to be any help to you I can't be worrying about my brother running off with some intergalactic skank! So, is there something else you need?",
      "nglobemiss13105_.mp3": "Mission - mission: is that supposed to be a joke? Like I've only heard that about a million times in my life! Okay, I can take a hint. You don't want to hear anymore. That's just fine.",
      "nglobemiss13107_.mp3": "Why do you got to go putting my brother down like that? That's just mean! Besides, it wasn't his idea to leave!",
      "nglobemiss13109_.mp3": "Yeah, Griff did right by me.",
      "nglobemiss13112_.mp3": "Oh... yeah. I understand. We've got bigger bantha to hunt, right? I just miss Griff, is all. I keep thinking things might have been different, you know?",
      "nglobemiss13114_.mp3": "No, I want to tell you. Zaalbar's a great listener but it might be nice to talk about this with someone who doesn't reply in growls and grunts.",
      "nglobemiss13116_.mp3": "Right, sure. I understand. We've got all this other stuff going on what with the Sith and all. You're busy. No problem. Maybe later we can talk. When you have more time, you know?",
      "nglobemiss13117_.mp3": "I'm not really in the mood to talk about my brother right now. Maybe we should just stay focused on the job at hand, you know?",
      "nglobemiss13118_.mp3": "So, is there anything else you need?",
      "nglobemiss13119_.mp3": "I'm sorry for the way I acted before. It's just that when it comes to Lena I tend to get a little worked up.",
      "nglobemiss13121_.mp3": "My brother and me had a good thing going. Sure, Griff had his run-ins with the law on Taris. But we got by okay. Until Lena came and ruined everything.",
      "nglobemiss13122_.mp3": "She was a dancer at the cantina where my brother used to go to play Pazaak. Griff could be a real smooth talker, and it wasn't long before the two of them were dating.",
      "nglobemiss13123_.mp3": "But Lena was used to dating rich Tarisian nobles - guys with mountains of credits. Griff could never give her the kind of lifestyle she was used to, no matter how hard he worked.",
      "nglobemiss13125_.mp3": "I'm not going to pretend Griff wasn't a hustler and a con-artist, but that doesn't mean you can just insult him! He did what he did to look out for me!",
      "nglobemiss13126_.mp3": "I thought Lena would brush Griff off when she saw how poor he was, but for some reason she stuck around. I guess she saw the potential for a big payday down the road.",
      "nglobemiss13128_.mp3": "I saw Lena for what she really was - a busty, credit-grubbing cantina rat! She used Griff and took away the only family I had!",
      "nglobemiss13129_.mp3": "After they'd been together for a few months, Griff told me he was leaving Taris. He and Lena were going to try and make their fortune off-world.",
      "nglobemiss13130_.mp3": "He promised as soon as he made enough credits he'd come back and get me and we'd all live like royalty. That was two years ago - I haven't seen him since! I don't even know where he went!",
      "nglobemiss13133_.mp3": "Oh, I know what happened! As soon as she got him off Taris Lena sunk her claws into Griff but good! She twisted him around her little finger and made him forget all about me!",
      "nglobemiss13134_.mp3": "I know I'll probably never see Griff again. But part of the reason I came with you was the hope that I could find out what happened to my brother.",
      "nglobemiss13135_.mp3": "Don't worry - I won't let my search for Griff get in the way of what we're doing. Let's just get back to the task at hand. Is there anything else I can help you with?",
      "nglobemiss13142_.mp3": "Don't tell me you believe Lena's lies? Griff might be working as a miner on Tatooine, but the rest of her story is bantha poo-doo! You can't trust someone like her.",
      "nglobemiss13143_.mp3": "At least Griff's free of her clutches. I'd like to go speak to the Czerka Corp rep on Tatooine, if we have time. Maybe I can arrange to see my brother again.",
      "nglobemiss13145_.mp3": "I just hope he's not in any kind of trouble when we do.",
      "nglobemiss13147_.mp3": "Sure, I understand. Saving the galaxy and all. All I'm saying is if we get time to make a quick sidetrip to Tatooine... look, just think about it, okay?",
      "nglobemiss13148_.mp3": "I've been thinking about Lena and what she said about Griff. You know, how he was always blaming other people for his problems. There might be something to what she said.",
      "nglobemiss13150_.mp3": "No, of course not. Not really. But what if... what if it was his idea to leave me behind? I'm not saying Griff would just abandon me.",
      "nglobemiss13151_.mp3": "But maybe... maybe he did want to leave me behind. Just temporarily, you know? He might have done that, if he planned on coming back later.",
      "nglobemiss13152_.mp3": "But things didn't usually work out for Griff the way he planned, you know? And that's when he'd get in trouble. He was always borrowing money he could never pay back.",
      "nglobemiss13153_.mp3": "He might have been trying to skip out on his debts when he left Taris. He would have had to leave his little sister behind so it would look like he was coming back.",
      "nglobemiss13155_.mp3": "Yeah... well, no. Not exactly. Look, all I'm trying to say is that the more I think back the more I realize I might be idolizing my brother a bit. Not seeing all his faults.",
      "nglobemiss13156_.mp3": "I still want to find him. I need to see him again. It's just that I'm not sure how I'll react when I do.",
      "nglobemiss13158_.mp3": "Maybe. We'll see. I don't... I don't want to judge him yet. Maybe Lena was lying. Or maybe... maybe she wasn't.",
      "nglobemiss13159_.mp3": "All I know is I'd like to speak to Griff myself. If we have time, I'd like to go talk to the Czerka Corp rep on Tatooine and see what he has to say about where my brother is now.",
      "nglobemiss13163_.mp3": "Talk? What is there to talk about? Those sandpeople took my brother prisoner!",
      "nglobemiss13164_.mp3": "Griff may be a slime but we have to go rescue him! We can't just leave him with those... those... those monsters!",
      "nglobemiss13166_.mp3": "I knew I could count on you! There's definite fringe benefits to being friends with a Jedi!",
      "nglobemiss13168_.mp3": "You heard the Czerka rep: the sandpeople sometimes take prisoners. Say what you want about Griff, but he's a survivor. I know he's still alive.",
      "nglobemiss13170_.mp3": "I know you're out to save the galaxy and all. But you can't just turn your back on someone who needs your help - you're a Jedi, not a Sith!",
      "nglobemiss13171_.mp3": "I can't make you go after my brother, but you're the only one who can save him. Just think about it, that's all I ask. In the end I know you'll do the right thing.",
      "nglobemiss13172_.mp3": "Look, I'm happy Griff's alive but I'm mad at him right now. And I don't know what kind of job he's got for you, but I don't trust him. It's probably just another scam!",
      "nglobemiss13173_.mp3": "I'm worried about Griff and his latest plan. I've got a bad feeling about it. He doesn't know anything about brewing Tarisian ale.",
      "nglobemiss13174_.mp3": "And now he's gotten himself mixed up with the Exchange. Sometimes Griff can be so stupid! Part of me just wants to let him get what's coming to him.",
      "nglobemiss13176_.mp3": "Why not? He turned his back on me! He abandoned me on Taris, so maybe I should just leave him high and dry now!",
      "nglobemiss13178_.mp3": "Maybe a couple broken knee-caps will do him some good! Maybe that's the kind of jolt he needs to turn his life around! Only... what if they do something worse?",
      "nglobemiss13179_.mp3": "They might kill him! I don't want him to die; he doesn't deserve that. But I can't just keep supporting his crazy schemes. Someone has to teach him a lesson!",
      "nglobemiss13181_.mp3": "Yeah, I guess you're right. I'm not going to change him. Griff is going to keep on being Griff. ",
      "nglobemiss13182_.mp3": "Maybe if we get these tach glands for him things will work out. Or maybe he'll finally see the light and turn over a new leaf. I know it's not likely, but it's all I have to hope for.",
      "nglobemiss13185_.mp3": "You're right! Griff may be my brother, but he deserted me on Taris. As far as I'm concerned that pretty much breaks any bond we had!",
      "nglobemiss13186_.mp3": "I'm not going to worry about Griff anymore. Like you said, he brought this on himself! Besides, he's always treated me like garbage. Now it's payback time!",
      "nglobemiss13188_.mp3": "Hey, if you want to help him with this Tarisian ale scheme that's your business. I'm washing my hands of the whole thing.",
      "nglobemiss13189_.mp3": "I appreciate everything you've done for Griff. You know that, right? I just hope things work out for him this time around.",
      "nglobemiss13190_.mp3": "I guess we'll find out when he meets up with us at the Czerka Corp shop. If he's got those credtis he promised you then maybe there's hope for him yet.",
      "nglobemiss13191_.mp3": "I want to thank you for helping me with Griff. You... you did everything you could for my brother. More than most people would have.",
      "nglobemiss13192_.mp3": "I know it might look like it didn't make any difference in the end... Griff's in debt and on the run like usual. But at least I know we tried to help him.",
      "nglobemiss13194_.mp3": "I know people can change no matter how bad they were. But I'm not holding my breath. None of us is perfect, but I've come to realize that Griff is a little less perfect than most.",
      "nglobemiss13196_.mp3": "Don't worry, I see all Griff's faults plainly now. None of us is perfect, but I realize he's a little less perfect than most.",
      "nglobemiss13199_.mp3": "I can't say I blame you. But I'll be honest... I doubt you'll ever see Griff again. I don't even know if I'll ever see him again. Like all good con men he knows how to disappear.",
      "nglobemiss13200_.mp3": "My brother is what he is, but I've learned to deal with that. I'll never forget that he looked after me when I was just a kid, but I don't feel like I owe him anything anymore.",
      "nglobemiss13202_.mp3": "I've made my peace with Griff and what he means to me. If he ever shows up again I'll deal with him, but I'm not going to dwell on my brother anymore. It's time to move forward!",
      "nglobemiss13206_.mp3": "Okay... have it your way.",
      "nglobemiss13207_.mp3": "Oh, heck, I don't know.",
      "nglobemiss13208_.mp3": "Umm... are you sure you want to ask me about that?",
      "nglobemiss13300_.mp3": "*whisper* Well, that was easy. I sure wish I had special mind-affecting Force powers.",
      "nglobemiss13301_.mp3": "*whisper* I can be pretty convincing when I have to be, but that mind trick is something else![R1]",
      "nglobemiss13302_.mp3": "Hey, why'd you have to do that? That was just mean!",
      "nglobemiss13303_.mp3": "You know what? Sometimes you're nothing but a bully!",
      "nglobemiss13304_.mp3": "I know you're supposed to save the galaxy and all, but could you try being less of a scummy core slime while you're doing it?",
      "nm02abgort09015_.mp3": "Yeah! You tell him, Big Z!",
      "nm02abgort09024_.mp3": "Do we have to stand here and listen to this space-slug? He's starting to get on my nerves, you know?",
      "nm02abgort09049_.mp3": "What a rail-slug! Give Big Z five minutes alone with that guy and he'd straighten him out... or maybe twist him like a Tarisian Zella nut.",
      "nm02abgort09056_.mp3": "Hmph! You may think it's okay to joke about killing aliens to string Gorton along, but I don't think that kind of thing is funny at all!",
      "nm02abithb10010_.mp3": "Hey! You aren't going to just let them keep hurting him, are ya?",
      "nm02abithb10016_.mp3": "You want me to come over their and kick your little butts?! That's it... now you're in for it!!",
      "nm02aenikl28040_.mp3": "Geez, what sore loser! I haven't seen this much whining since I gave Zaalbar that bath!",
      "nm03aakand01024_.mp3": "Brejik stole that engine from Gadon! It was never yours to begin with!",
      "nm03aakand01031_.mp3": "What? You can't betray Gadon! I won't let you!",
      "nm03aakand01033_.mp3": "No, that's not true! You're lying!",
      "nm03aakand01035_.mp3": "They... they said I was too young!",
      "nm03aakand01037_.mp3": "Well, yeah. Some of them were. But you Vulkars have tried to kill me more than once!",
      "nm03aakand01039_.mp3": "But... but Gadon said Brejik...",
      "nm03aakand01041_.mp3": "You're right! I don't need anyone but Zaalbar! If Gadon dies, he's only getting what's coming to him!",
      "nm03aehold13002_.mp3": "Ugh - what a pig! He even makes Gamorreans look classy.",
      "nm03aehold13018_.mp3": "Yeah, sure. You were as innocent as a Jawa in a droid chop shop!",
      "nm03aemiss14000_.mp3": "I told you to leave me alone - so give me some space, Bug-eye! Your breath smells like bantha poodoo!",
      "nm03aemiss14004_.mp3": "Who you calling a little girl, Chuba-face?",
      "nm03aemiss14008_.mp3": "Just a sec, boys. Zaalbar... a little help here? I need you to rip the legs off some insects.",
      "nm03aemiss14012_.mp3": "Quit complaining... you can finish eating later. Besides, you need the exercise so get over here.",
      "nm03aemiss14016_.mp3": "You got a problem with me, then you got a problem with Big Z. So unless you want to take on my furry friend, I suggest you greenies hop on out of here.",
      "nm03aemiss14020_.mp3": "Say, I don't recognize you and I know pretty much everyone in the Lower City. You must be new down here. I guess that makes me and Big Z your official welcoming committee! ",
      "nm03aemiss14022_.mp3": "It's not that strange. Most aliens can speak Basic, they just prefer to use their own language. But I grew up here on Taris so I just sort of got used to speaking the native tongue.",
      "nm03aemiss14024_.mp3": "My name's Mission Vao and this big Wookiee is my best friend, Zaalbar. I'd offer to give you a tour, but the streets down here aren't safe. But if there's anything else you need...",
      "nm03aemiss14026_.mp3": "The Black Vulkar base? You'll never get in there - they attack on sight. But if you got a problem with the Vulkars, you should go speak to the Hidden Beks.",
      "nm03aemiss14028_.mp3": "Their base is open to anyone - I hang out there all the time. Gadon, the leader of the Hidden Beks, is a pretty good guy. He'll probably be able to help you out.",
      "nm03aemiss14030_.mp3": "Yeah, we should be going now, too. Come on, Zaalber. This dive is boring. Maybe we can find some action in the Undercity.",
      "nm03aemiss14033_.mp3": "Well, you came to the right person! If you want info on Lower Taris I'm the one to talk to! Davik, the Lower City gangs... I've even got the scoop on that bounty hunter Calo Nord!",
      "nm03aemiss14035_.mp3": "We just kind of fell in together. It ain't easy on your own here in the Lower City - everyone's always looking to push you around.",
      "nm03aemiss14039_.mp3": "When I met up with Zaalbar it seemed like a good match. I knew we could look out for each other. With my street smarts and his muscle, we make a great team.",
      "nm03aemiss14041_.mp3": "Davik's part of the intergalactic crime syndicate, but I guess everyone knows that. But I hear he's got a new ship for his smuggling operations - the Ebon Hawk.",
      "nm03aemiss14043_.mp3": "I don't know much about space travel, but I hear that ship's fast enough to break the Sith blockade. Of course, this is all just second hand rumor.",
      "nm03aemiss14045_.mp3": "Where would he keep it? Do you know?",
      "nm03aemiss14047_.mp3": "If Davik does have a ship, he's got it locked up in his estate. Nobody gets in there, except the people working for Davik and the Exchange.",
      "nm03aemiss14049_.mp3": "There's only two gangs worth worrying about here in the Lower City: the Black Vulkars and the Hidden Beks. Sometimes Zaalbar and I hang out at the Bek base.",
      "nm03aemiss14051_.mp3": "The Beks are led by Gadon Thek - he's a good guy. Lost his sight in a swoop bike accident a few years ago, but even blind he's a great leader.",
      "nm03aemiss14053_.mp3": "Not like that traitor Brejik! Before he took over the Vulkars he was a Hidden Bek. Gadon considered that ungrateful space slug his adopted son.",
      "nm03aemiss14055_.mp3": "When Gadon went blind everyone figured he'd step down and appoint Brejik in his place. But Gadon figured Brejik wasn't ready yet. He wanted him to wait a few years.",
      "nm03aemiss14057_.mp3": "But Brejik was too impatient. He left to join the Vulkars, and ever since he's been waging a war to wipe Gadon and his Beks from the face of Taris!",
      "nm03aemiss14059_.mp3": "This gang war in the Lower City is totally the Vulkar's fault. They're the ones killing everything that moves out on the street. It's like they've gone insane.",
      "nm03aemiss14061_.mp3": "Calo Nord's one of the most famous bounty hunters in the galaxy. He's killed more people than the Iridian Plague! I've seen him kill people just for trying to talk to him!",
      "nm03aemiss14063_.mp3": "He hangs around Zax's bounty office, but I don't think he's looking for work there. All the postings there are small time - way beneath a bounty hunter of his caliber.",
      "nm03aemiss14065_.mp3": "I figure Calo's been hired by Davik to do a special job for the Exchange. I'd wager a thousand credits that as soon as the quarantine ends, he'll be getting off this rock.",
      "nm03aemiss14067_.mp3": "You're going? Yeah, this dive is pretty boring. No action around here. Come on, Big Z, let's go.",
      "nm03aemiss14071_.mp3": "Can't you think about something besides your stomach for five minutes? Come on - we'll go see if there's anything good to eat at the Bek base.",
      "nm03aezaal18002_.mp3": "Hey, relax Big Z. No need to be rude. Sorry about that, but Wookiees ain't much for conversation, you know?",
      "nm04aamiss10000_.mp3": "Please, you have to help me! Nobody else is going to help me. Even the Beks won't help me. But I can't just leave him there - he's my friend! You'll help me, won't you?",
      "nm04aamiss10002_.mp3": "It's Zaalbar. He's in trouble - big trouble! We have to help him. If we don't they'll sell him into slavery!",
      "nm04aamiss10004_.mp3": "Me... me and Zaalbar were just wandering around here in the Undercity. You know, looking for stuff we could find, just kind of exploring. We do it all the time.",
      "nm04aamiss10006_.mp3": "Only this time they were waiting for us. Gamorrean slave hunters. We didn't even have a chance to run. Big Z threw himself at them, and he roared for me to run!",
      "nm04aamiss10008_.mp3": "I... I took off; I figured Zaalbar would be right behind me. But there were too many of them - he couldn't get away. They're going to sell him to a slaver - I just know it!",
      "nm04aamiss10010_.mp3": "I don't know for sure, but those Gamorreans like to hang out in the sewers. The stink reminds them of home, I guess. That's probably where they took Big Z.",
      "nm04aamiss10012_.mp3": "I didn't mean to leave him! I thought he was right behind me - I'd never abandon Big Z on purpose! Please - help me get him back.",
      "nm04aamiss10014_.mp3": "No way. I'm the one that got Zaalbar into this mess, so I'm coming with you. I'm not going to abandon him again!",
      "nm04aamiss10018_.mp3": "Listen, my friend Zaalbar is in serious trouble, so you can forget about me helping with anything else until I get him back!",
      "nm04aamiss10021_.mp3": "Gadon? What? I... I don't know what you're talking about. Please - Zaalbar's in trouble. He needs help or they're going to sell him into slavery!",
      "nm04aamiss10022_.mp3": "You're back - does this mean you're going to help me now? Does this mean you're going to help me get Zaalbar back?",
      "nm04aamiss10024_.mp3": "It's a deal - as soon as we get Big Z back, I'll show you a way into that Vulkar base! Now, come on - We have to find Zaalbar before they sell him to slavers - or worse!",
      "nm04aamiss10028_.mp3": "The Gamorreans make their camps in the sewers. I bet that's where we'll find Zaalbar - and that's where I'll show you the secret entrance into the Vulkar compound.",
      "nm04aamiss10031_.mp3": "I can't ask Gadon - he's always telling me not to go into the Undercity. He says it's too dangerous with the rakghouls and Gamorreans and all. He'll never send his Beks down there.",
      "nm04aamiss10034_.mp3": "Pleeeze! There's nobody else who can help me! Listen - if you help me get Zaalbar back, I'll help you get inside the Vulkar base. Come on, what do you say?",
      "nm04aamiss10036_.mp3": "How can you be so stubborn? When you're ready to help me with Zaalbar come on back - because you'll never get into that Vulkar base without my help!",
      "nm04aaoutw22034_.mp3": "He WILL make it! Run, Hendar! Run!",
      "nm04aaruki25051_.mp3": "Watch yourself: this guy's star chart is missing a few galaxies, if you know what I mean.",
      "nm04aaruki25111_.mp3": "What did you expect? If they could get away with it the Tarisian nobles would stuff their own mothers down here to make more room in the Upper City. ",
      "nm05aaff0299000_.mp3": "You won't be able to get that computer to lower the energy field unless you know the proper codes. Lucky for you, I've got them.",
      "nm05aaff0299001_.mp3": "I picked them off the pocket of a Black Vulkar who had a little too much to drink in the cantina one night. Here, let me get that energy field down for you.",
      "nm05aaff0299002_.mp3": "That energy shield leads to another section of the sewers. The entrance to the Vulkar base is somewhere past there.",
      "nm05aaff0299003_.mp3": "I've got the codes to lower the shield, but we have to rescue Zaalbar from those Gamorrean slavers. Don't worry - we can come back after we find Big Z.",
      "nm05aaffxx01002_.mp3": "You won't be able to get that computer to lower the energy field unless you know the proper codes. Lucky for you, I've got them.",
      "nm05aaffxx01003_.mp3": "I picked them off the pocket of a Black Vulkar who had a little too much to drink in the cantina one night. Here, let me get that energy field down for you.",
      "nm05aamiss01000_.mp3": "Hmmm... look at this. This is one of those old style manual locks. No computer codes or nothing. The sewers is the only place you'll see one of these on Taris.",
      "nm05aamiss01001_.mp3": "You can't use conventional security spikes on these old locks, but don't worry. I've come across them before. I've rigged up a little device that should do the trick.",
      "nm05aazaal03001_.mp3": "I'm glad to see you too, Big Z! You didn't think I'd forget about you - Mission and Zaalbar, together forever!",
      "nm05aazaal03003_.mp3": "These are my new friends, Big Z. Without them I never could have got you out. ",
      "nm05aazaal03006_.mp3": "A lifedebt? Are you sure about that, Big Z? Think about it carefully. You better be sure about this.",
      "nm05aazaal03010_.mp3": "Big Z swearing a Wookiee lifedebt to you. Wow - this is major. Do you realize what this means?",
      "nm05aazaal03013_.mp3": "A lifedebt is the most solemn vow a Wookiee can make. It means he'll stay by your side for the rest of your life - wherever you go, whatever you do, Zaalbar will be with you.",
      "nm05aazaal03016_.mp3": "I guess this means you're stuck with me too. Wherever Big Z goes, I'm going. I almost lost him once - it's not going to happen again.",
      "nm05aazaal03018_.mp3": "So... I guess I still owe you one secret path into the Vulkar base. That was the deal, wasn't it? Don't worry, I know a backdoor into that scum den!",
      "nm05aazaal03020_.mp3": "I better come with you - the Vulkars put up a force shield to keep the sewer dwellers out. I'm one of the only non-Vulkars on Taris who can get you past it.",
      "nm05aazaal03021_.mp3": "I can't remember exactly how to get there, but I know it was somewhere here in the sewers. Over to the northeast, if I remember right. I just hope the rancor monster isn't still there.",
      "nm05aazaal03023_.mp3": "There used to be a rancor monster that made its nest in that part of the sewers. Pretty much eats anything it can get its claws on. That thing is huge!",
      "nm05aazaal03024_.mp3": "Luckily rancors aren't too bright. I was able to sneak past it before, so I'm sure we'll figure something out. That is, unless you want to change your mind.",
      "nm05aazaal03026_.mp3": "Okay then, off we go. Like I said, somewhere to the south-east. Just look for the force shield and we'll know we're there.",
      "nm05aazaal03031_.mp3": "You did a good job mopping up those Gamorreans, but I don't think you want to take on a rancor! Those things are huge!",
      "nm05aazaal03034_.mp3": "Hey - don't underestimate me! I may be young, but I'm quick and plenty smart. You just give me a chance and you'll be surprised at how useful I can be.",
      "nm05aazaal03037_.mp3": "Sorry, but there's not much you can do about it. Zaalbar's already sworn the lifedebt and it's not something they can just take back. This is a sacred, irreversible vow.",
      "nm05aazaal03040_.mp3": "Hey - don't make fun of the lifedebt! This is serious business, you know?",
      "nm05aazaal03042_.mp3": "Hey - Zaalbar's not your slave! He just swore a lifedebt to you. It's not the same thing.",
      "nm10ackand01036_.mp3": "Brejik stole that engine from Gadon! It was never yours to begin with!",
      "nm10ackand01048_.mp3": "What? You can't betray Gadon! I won't let you!",
      "nm10ackand01052_.mp3": "No, that's not true! You're lying!",
      "nm10ackand01056_.mp3": "They... they said I was too young!",
      "nm10ackand01060_.mp3": "Well, yeah. Some of them were. But you Vulkars have tried to kill me more than once!",
      "nm10ackand01064_.mp3": "But... but Gadon said Brejik...",
      "nm10ackand01068_.mp3": "You're right! I don't need anyone but Zaalbar! If Gadon dies, he's only getting what's coming to him!",
      "nm11aazaer09026_.mp3": "Gadon always was too soft on Brejik. I just wish I'd been there when that scum got what was coming to him!",
      "nm11aazaer09039_.mp3": "Gadon always was too soft on Brejik. I just wish I'd been there when that scum got what was coming to him!",
      "nm13aacrat07087_.mp3": "He makes a good case. It's not like you'd be stealing or killing anyone or anything.",
      "nm13aajuha11025_.mp3": "Hey, I'm glad to see you're not getting hung up on all this. The past is in the past, you know?",
      "nm13aavand17311_.mp3": "*whisper* Anyone can see that he doesn't believe you. He must have some reason for letting this slide. Probably trying to teach you some Jedi lesson or something.",
      "nm14aajon006023_.mp3": "Wow, talk about an ego trip! You Jedi aren't perfect; remember Revan and Malak? Maybe these Mandalorians are worth looking into.",
      "nm14abahla01048_.mp3": "This guy's a real pain! It wouldn't surprise me if Shen ran off just to get away from his father!",
      "nm14abmdro03026_.mp3": "Figures. We get his son back for him, and now the stuck-up estate owner won't have anything to do with us!",
      "nm17aa03sh01166_.mp3": "Wow, sometimes helping people feels pretty good, you know?",
      "nm17aaiziz99150_.mp3": "Hey, why are you being so mean to this little guy? What did he ever do to you?",
      "nm17abgrif04002_.mp3": "I... I have to ask you something, Griff. It's important. I ran into Lena. She said... she said it was your idea to leave me on Taris. It's not true, is it?",
      "nm17abgrif04008_.mp3": "You... you're hitting me up for credits? I don't believe this! Lena was right about you, Griff! We should have just left you to the Sand People! Don't talk to me anymore - ever!",
      "nm17abgrif04035_.mp3": "You mean it's true? It was your idea to leave me there? I'm your sister - how could you abandon me like that?",
      "nm17abgrif04037_.mp3": "That's it? That's all you have to say to me after all these years after deserting me on Taris?",
      "nm17ac08yu02073_.mp3": "Gee, that doesn't sound suspicious at all. Warehouse workers have a bad habit of paying off their debts with other people's property, you know.",
      "nm17ad03gu03078_.mp3": "Aw, geez! I hope this doesn't take too long; Gamorreans like to throw insults around, but they just don't have the smarts for it.",
      "nm17ae04ce02010_.mp3": "Nobody here can compare with the racers you rode against on Taris. You'll wipe every record from the books on this backwater track!",
      "nm17ae04ce02030_.mp3": "That isn't fair! On Taris you had to give a cut to the swoop gang sponsoring you, but at least the rider got the higher share of the winnings.",
      "nm17ae04ni04037_.mp3": "That promoter's going to bleed that poor kid dry... but I guess he's got to learn the only way to get by in this life is to look out for yourself!",
      "nm17ag01gr02001_.mp3": "I don't like the sound of this.",
      "nm17ag01gr02012_.mp3": "Damn it, Griff - won't you ever learn? How can my own flesh and blood be so stupid! ",
      "nm17aggrif03002_.mp3": "Hmph! Save it Griff - I'm still not talking to you! I want no part of whatever you're involved in!",
      "nm17aggrif03016_.mp3": "Griff, are you blind? Can't you see you're talking to a Jedi? We're out here trying to save the galaxy! We can't waste time on this!",
      "nm17aggrif03027_.mp3": "Forget it, Griff, I'm not falling for that line again. You'll have to find your own way out of this mess!",
      "nm17aggrif03048_.mp3": "This wasn't my idea, Griff. If it was up to me I'd let the Exchange deal with you!",
      "nm17aggrif03052_.mp3": "Forget it, Griff. Don't you understand? It's too late - you're dead to me now. I don't want anything more to do with you. Ever.",
      "nm17aggrif03056_.mp3": "Please, Griff. Let this be the last time. No more cons. No more scams. No more schemes. That's all I ask.",
      "nm18ackoma99130_.mp3": "You're going to turn on this guy now? This is low, even for you.",
      "nm18acstar99010_.mp3": "Hey - it's one of those Star Maps, ain't it? Kind of weird finding it in the back of a krayt dragon's lair, don't you think?",
      "nm18acstar99011_.mp3": "Say, now that we've got the Star Map do you think we can leave this planet soon? I've got sand *everywhere*!",
      "nm20aagrif05001_.mp3": "Griff, don't you recognize me? It's Mission!",
      "nm20aagrif05003_.mp3": "I... I have to ask you something, Griff. It's important. I ran into Lena. She said... she said it was your idea to leave me on Taris. It's not true, is it?",
      "nm20aagrif05005_.mp3": "You mean it's true? It was your idea to leave me there? I'm your sister - how could you abandon me like that?",
      "nm20aagrif05009_.mp3": "You... you're hitting me up for credits? I don't believe this! Lena was right about you, Griff! We should have just left you to the Sand People! Don't talk to me anymore - ever!",
      "nm20aagrif05020_.mp3": "Hmph!",
      "nm20aagrif05034_.mp3": "Yeah, you can find your way from there, right? Can you manage that? What? Is there something else?",
      "nm20aagrif05036_.mp3": "We'd be risking everything just to get you out! That doesn't bother you?",
      "nm20aagrif05041_.mp3": "And you'd better appreciate it!",
      "nm20aagrif05045_.mp3": "Yeah, you can just stay here!",
      "nm20aagrif05052_.mp3": "Hey now, I don't want him dead. Well, maybe I do, but couldn't we just let him sit here and think about things for a while?",
      "nm20aagrif05061_.mp3": "You can just keep waiting, Griff. We'll get you out of there when it suits us.",
      "nm22aaczer03011_.mp3": "That's horrible! You wouldn't talk like that if Big Z was here!",
      "nm22aaelix08041_.mp3": "You mean they don't tolerate cheats!",
      "nm22aaelix08052_.mp3": "Something about this whole situation stinks worse than an overcrowded ronto stable! What kind of friends would just abandon a crew mate?",
      "nm22aazaal01029_.mp3": "Zaalbar should be here. He shouldn't miss this. He needs to know he can come back here.",
      "nm22aazaal01031_.mp3": "I can't talk for Big Z, but believe me, he should be with us. He's got... unfinished business here.",
      "nm22aazaal01033_.mp3": "I'm not saying that I know better than you, but this is Zaalbar's home. Don't you think he'd know some things?",
      "nm22aazaal01035_.mp3": "Besides, he's got things here he needs to take care of.",
      "nm22abchor02050_.mp3": "Big Z once told me he had seen paradise destroyed by the greed of outsiders. I never understood what he meant until now.",
      "nm22abdehn06110_.mp3": "I'm glad Big Z isn't here to see this. I don't know if he could handle it.",
      "nm22abzaal01023_.mp3": "I never thought I'd see the big trees. Zaalbar's stories didn't do it justice. This is incredible.",
      "nm22abzaal01025_.mp3": "I wish he was here to see this. He'd want to see this, you know?",
      "nm23abjaar01013_.mp3": "It isn't an easy language to learn, what with all the growls and howls. Big Z told me the whole point was to make it difficult for outsiders to understand.",
      "nm23abjaar01052_.mp3": "Yours? Why would we find your casing beside... no, it couldn't be. Could it?",
      "nm23acworr01036_.mp3": "Big Z says honor was everything to his people. I... guess he's right.",
      "nm23acworr01056_.mp3": "How awful. Big Z always said how important honor was to his people. It's everything.",
      "nm23adchuu01047_.mp3": "You're not fooling anyone, ya know.",
      "nm23adchuu01051_.mp3": "If you say so, Big Z.",
      "nm23adchuu01070_.mp3": "Whoa, Big Z! Settle down! I've never seen him this angry before!",
      "nm23adchuu01139_.mp3": "I... guess he *did* toss you out on your ear, Big Z. What kind of father is that?",
      "nm23adchuu01161_.mp3": "Alright! Way to go, Big Z!",
      "nm23adchuu01172_.mp3": "Woo-hoo! Way to go, Big Z!",
      "nm23adchuu01220_.mp3": "You can't do that! He can't do that, can he? He can't hold Zaalbar prisoner just because he's Chieftain, can he?",
      "nm23adchuu01246_.mp3": "Don't worry, buddy, we'll get you out of here. You can count on us!",
      "nm23adchuu01299_.mp3": "Big Z! What are you doing here? What's going on?",
      "nm23adfrey02031_.mp3": "Look, Big Z may owe you a life-debt but you've got to cut him some slack!",
      "nm23adfrey02064_.mp3": "Careful, I've seen Zaalbar get this mad too. There's no persuading him when it happens.",
      "nm23adfrey02083_.mp3": "Oh boy, now you've done it. No way he'd say okay to that.",
      "nm24aajole06203_.mp3": "It's kind of nice to meet a Jedi who isn't all hung up on this light side, dark side stuff. It gets pretty tiring, you know?",

      "nm25aastar99011_.mp3": "I guess it's possible the Star Map could have been built before these trees popped up. It's just hard to imagine Kashyyyk with no forests, you know?",

      "nm39aastar99003_.mp3": "Look, we've got what we came for. Can we go now? This place gives me the creeps.",
      "nm40aacart05022_.mp3": "Maybe I can goad the guards into making a mistake! If I get them mad enough, they might put me in a separate cell to punish me.",
      "nm40aacart05024_.mp3": "With them focusing so much on you three I might be able to sneak out of my cell and come rescue the rest of you.",

      "nm40aamiss08010_.mp3": "Who designed those Sith uniforms anyway? A blind Rodian with a sick sense of humor?",
      "nm40aamiss08014_.mp3": "What? You're... you're going to torture me?",
      "nm40aamiss08020_.mp3": "Or I could use the keycard I lifted from your pocket to slice into the security panel and get myself out of this cell.",
      "nm40aamiss08022_.mp3": "Piece of cake! I wonder when people will stop underestimating me?",

      "nm40adcart01044_.mp3": "Hey - you've got nothing to be sorry about! You didn't ask for this. Besides, I know you... you're not Revan anymore. Whatever you used to be, you're one of us now!",
      "nm40adcart01046_.mp3": "I don't see the Sith Lord standing here, I see a friend who's been with us through thick and thin! Remember - Malak's the one who tried to destroy Taris!",

      "nm41aacart03032_.mp3": "Oh, sure. Even a good omen can get itself a room, though, don't ya think?",

      "nm41aacart03111_.mp3": "Whew! Talk about your rough landings, Carth! What's the matter? You're flying like you've been on an all night Tarisian ale drinking binge!",

      "nm17abgrif04006_.mp3": "That and... uh you look good, sis. Like you're doing well. Financially, I mean. Say... you think you could spare me a few credits to get back on my feet, do you? Um...",
      "nm17abgrif04010_.mp3": "Huh... that didn't go well. Sis always was a little too fiery for her own good. She'll cool down in time.",

      "nm17abgrif04017_.mp3": "That's it, huh? Oh, figured you would be able to spare a bit more than that, but, you know, I'll take whatever I can get. Don't worry about me... I've already got a job waiting for me.",
      "nm17abgrif04019_.mp3": "Greeta, the manager over at the Czerka supply shop, said I could come work for him if I ever get tired of the mines. I think I'll go take him up on his offer.",

      "nm17ad03do01010_.mp3": "Why don't *you* tell me? You've killed a dragon. Me, I just make do hunting desert wraid. And there's not many of those even left.",
      "nm17ad03do01011_.mp3": "If I knew the best place, why would I tell anyone? It would be worth too much to me to let it get out.",
      "nm17ad03do01012_.mp3": "It doesn't matter, anyway. This season has been dry for me, as it has for almost everyone.",
      "nm17ad03do01013_.mp3": "Perhaps someone else is holding out, but there are simply fewer wraid out there.",
      "nm17ad03do01015_.mp3": "It used to be a one-on-one test, hunter against hunted. Now, people just want the credits.",
      "nm17ad03do01016_.mp3": "I could stomach maybe a pair, or a team of hunters, but some now use battle droids! Where is the sport in that?",

      "nm17ad03do01020_.mp3": "That's not for me to say. I won't be a troublemaker in so small a community. You will see. Hunt, and you will see.",
      "nm17ad03do01022_.mp3": "I've tracked wild beasts my whole life, but I've only been hunting here for five years. I've much to learn yet.",
      "nm17ad03do01024_.mp3": "I want to learn how hunters like you find the big kills. Not that I'd survive hunting a dragon, but it would be a fine battle.",

      "nm17ad03do01026_.mp3": "There are hunters that go after the big kills, the krayt dragons. I don't know how they do it. I never even see the things.",
      "nm17ad03do01027_.mp3": "Komad is the one I respect, but I also trust that the only difference between us is experience. I will learn.",
      "nm17ad03do01029_.mp3": "I don't go telling stories about other people. You want to know what they think, you go talk to them.",
      "nm17ad03do01030_.mp3": "Although I don't hold out much hope for you surviving. I heard how you gave in to the Gamorreans.",

      "nm17ad03do01032_.mp3": "You seem pretty prepared to hold your own with most of them. I heard what happened with the Gamorreans.",

      "nm17ad03do01034_.mp3": "Ah, one word though. Watch yourself around the Gamorreans. Gurke and his buddies aren't to be trusted.",
      "nm17ad03do01035_.mp3": "Everyone else I respect because they have skill. Those guys... they go for easier prey.",
      "nm17ad03do01037_.mp3": "Just watch your back when you hunt. The dragons aren't the only dangers out there.",
      "nm17ad03do01039_.mp3": "If that's what you want. I'm not sure what you hope to get out of me, though.",
      "nm17ad03do01041_.mp3": "You'll have to ask around. Komad Fortuna is a much more experienced hunter than I am... he hunts far from Anchorhead.",
      "nm17ad03do01042_.mp3": "The local Jawas are a good source of information, even if it is hard to understand them. It may cost you, though.",
      "nm17ad03do01044_.mp3": "If he's not here in Fazza's, he's probably out wandering the desert. I don't know how you'd find him out there.",
      "nm17ad03do01045_.mp3": "Seems like he knows the desert as well as Jawas and Sand People. He doesn't say much about it though.",
      "nm17ad03do01047_.mp3": "See you around. Good luck.",

      "nm17ad03do01054_.mp3": "What? Fine, fine, take some cred's. It just isn't worth fighting over. Happy now? Better be.",
      "nm17ad03do01056_.mp3": "Easy now, come on! Look, I don't want any trouble. I'll just leave, all right? Don't worry about me.",
      "nm17ad03do01058_.mp3": "This really isn't worth the headache. How about I just leave. Here, take my seat.",

      "nm17ad03do01061_.mp3": "Hmm? You know, I don't have that much to tell you. You really have to get out on the dunes for yourself.",

      "nm02aecand30048_.mp3": "Uh-uh. Not yet. First, you bring me the launch codes. Then I'll tell you the rest of my plan.",
      "nm02aecand30050_.mp3": "Getting in won't be easy: the Sith base is protected by an encrypted security system. It would take a top of the line astromech droid to slice through it.",
      "nm02aecand30052_.mp3": "But that little T3 unit you got from Janice should be good enough to get the job done.",
      "nm02aecand30053_.mp3": "Lucky for you I know just the place to get a droid like that. Davik was having one custom built by Janice Nall.",
      "nm02aecand30056_.mp3": "Look, I don't like working with strangers either but we don't have much choice. I can provide the ship, you can get me those codes. We need each other. ",

      "nm02aecand30068_.mp3": "Damn, you're stubborn! We both want off the planet, but neither one of us can pull it off alone! Bring me the launch codes and we'll both get what we want.",

      "nm02aecand30095_.mp3": "Just tell her Canderous sent you and she'll sell you the droid. Then you can use it to get the launch codes from the Sith base.",
      "nm02aecand30098_.mp3": "Davik paid for the droid, but I'm the guy he put in charge of this mission. He won't care how I come up with those codes.",
      "nm02aecand30099_.mp3": "Normally I'd do this myself, but everyone knows who I work for. If I broke into the Sith base, they'd send an army down on Davik's estate to get those codes back. That's why I need you.",

      "nm03aacand07006_.mp3": "Besides, you know the arrangement. You Sith don't interfere with Davik's business and you all get a nice cut of his action.",
      "nm03aacand07009_.mp3": "Sorry, but I don't usually volunteer information to anyone who just asks.",

      "nm04aacand02006_.mp3": "Hm... by looks of you I'd say you're down here for the same reason we are: to salvage something from those downed Republic space pods. ",
      "nm04aacand02008_.mp3": "Let me give you some advice: forget about it. Do yourself a favor and just head back the way you came.",
      "nm04aacand02010_.mp3": "Mandalorians don't make threats, we make promises. But I'm just trying to give you a friendly warning. ",
      "nm04aacand02013_.mp3": "This isn't a good place to stand around chatting. The Undercity is crawling with rakghouls. I've already lost half a dozen men to those monsters.",
      "nm04aacand02017_.mp3": "Looks like we've got company! Get those blasters ready, boys! ",
      "nm04aacand02023_.mp3": "Trying to pick a fight with a Mandalorian - I can see you're not too bright. But I'm on a mission for Davik, so I don't have time for fun and games.",
      "nm04aacand02025_.mp3": "Damn! I told Davik this salvage mission was a bad idea! His men aren't trained for this kind of thing, and I can't babysit them all!",
      "nm04aacand02027_.mp3": "Okay, boys... we're getting out of here before I lose anyone else. I can't carry all this salvage back by myself!",
      "nm04aacand02029_.mp3": "You'd be smart to get out of here as well. Even if you can handle the rakghouls I doubt there's anything worth finding anymore. ",
      "nm04aacand02031_.mp3": "Davik sent me down here with this motley crew to scavenge whatever we could from the Republic escape pods that crashed during the recent battle overhead.",
      "nm04aacand02033_.mp3": "But the Lower City gangs got here first. Anything worthwhile in those Republic pods is probably in their hands now. Davik won't like that.",
      "nm04aacand02035_.mp3": "What are you, an off-worlder? Everybody knows Davik. He's a member of the Exchange. You know - the interstellar crime syndicate.",
      "nm04aacand02037_.mp3": "Smuggling, gambling, extortion - Davik controls it all here on Taris. That's why I'm working for him. But lately the Lower City gangs have been giving my boss some trouble.",
      "nm04aacand02039_.mp3": "This isn't really the place to have these kind of conversations. But I guess I could spare a couple seconds for you - after all, you did help us out with those rakghouls.",
      "nm04aacand02041_.mp3": "The Lower City is overrun with gangs, but the two most important ones are the Hidden Beks and the Black Vulkars. Used to be the Beks were the big dog and kept the others in line.",
      "nm04aacand02043_.mp3": "But lately the Black Vulkars are moving in on Bek turf and challenging them for control. The Vulkars are even starting to defy Davik!",
      "nm04aacand02045_.mp3": "Take these escape pods, for example. Everyone knew Davik would want first crack at them, but I know for a fact those damn Vulkars have already sent their own salvage party down here.",
      "nm04aacand02047_.mp3": "I think you're a fool to stay down here, but you did help us out in the battle with those rakghouls. I guess I could give you a little tip to make your life easier.",
      "nm04aacand02049_.mp3": "Davik had us looking for two escape pods. According to our info, one crashed just to the west of here and the other is somewhere to the northeast.",
      "nm04aacand02051_.mp3": "You might be able to find something worthwhile inside one of them. As for me, I'm getting back to the surface before I lose my whole company.",
      "nm04aacand02054_.mp3": "Normally I'd make you regret those words, but I'm not wasting another minute down here. I'm responsible for this whole company, and they won't survive down here much longer.",
      "nm04aacand02056_.mp3": "Come on boys... let's move out!",
      "nm08aacand04000_.mp3": "Let's get this ship fired up. We'll pick up the rest of your friends and then we have to get off this planet!",
      "nm08aadavi08004_.mp3": "Watch yourself, Calo. You may be the newest kath hound in the pack, but you aren't top dog yet!",
      "nm08aadavi08008_.mp3": "This is a special case, Davik. I ran into someone the Exchange might want to recruit. You may have heard something of their exploits already.",
      "nm08aadavi08047_.mp3": "Okay, we're inside. Now all we have to do is figure out a way to get past the Ebon Hawk's security system and we can get the rest of your group and get off this planet!",
      "nm08aadavi08049_.mp3": "No sense waiting around here, though. The sooner we get off Taris the better.",
      "nm08aadavs10004_.mp3": "Heh. Now this is my kind of place!",
      "nm08aahudr11011_.mp3": "We've got what we came for. We should get going.",
      "nm13aacand03000_.mp3": "I don't think we can delay much here. We should fight our way out as quickly as possible.",
      "nm13aacand03001_.mp3": "This looks like the end of our partnership. The battle we fight here will change the face of the galaxy.",
      "nm13aacand03002_.mp3": "You, Revan, are the single greatest warrior of this age, and any battle we fight will bring me honor. I'll stay by your side through anything.",
      "nm13aacand03003_.mp3": "I don't think I'm ready to give up this life of mine, this life of fighting, not quite yet. We have things we need to do here.",
      "nm13aacand03004_.mp3": "I'm your man until the end, whatever path you take.",
      "nm13aacand03005_.mp3": "I've been given a challenge I can't ignore. We've got to go to the dune seas of Tatooine so I can find Jagi and kill him for his insult to me!",
      "nm13aacand03008_.mp3": "This is between me and Jagi. You don't have to get involved. If you're lucky, he might spill something before I spread him in a paste over the dunes.",
      "nm13aacand03010_.mp3": "The sooner we get to Tatooine the better.",
      "nm13aacand03011_.mp3": "I... I think this has affected me in ways that I didn't anticipate... I think I'll need time to sort things out.",
      "nm13aacand03012_.mp3": "Thanks for what you did, whatever your intentions might have been. I just need... time.",
      "nm13aacand03013_.mp3": "Yeah? What do you want?",
      "nm13aacand03015_.mp3": "*grunt* Yeah, I know about Taris. I wasted the last two years in this rat-hole working for Davik.",
      "nm13aacand03016_.mp3": "I suppose an accurate way to describe this place would be 'cesspool' or 'dump'.",
      "nm13aacand03017_.mp3": "You got the rich people on top, the poor people being crushed underneath, and people like me trying to make a living doing the crushing.",
      "nm13aacand03018_.mp3": "It's not exactly what you'd call spiritually fulfilling work, but it gets the bills paid. And on Taris, money can go a long way to making things easier.",
      "nm13aacand03019_.mp3": "You have anything else you want to ask?",
      "nm13aacand03020_.mp3": "From what we saw from space this world doesn't have a lot of people. I couldn't really have found much work here anyway, so I never had an interest.",
      "nm13aacand03021_.mp3": "It looks like a farm world. The Republic has thousands of these places - ones that get by farming crops and hunting herds of native beasts.",
      "nm13aacand03022_.mp3": "But I might have underestimated this place. It seems to be more than I had thought.",
      "nm13aacand03023_.mp3": "Water worlds never had much of an appeal for us to conquer. They may put up a good fight in their own environment - no match for us, of course - but they don't really have anything of value either.",
      "nm13aacand03024_.mp3": "The thing this world is good for is a substance known as Kolto. Kolto is the single best healing substance in the galaxy.",
      "nm13aacand03025_.mp3": "But the Mandalore are not as weak and fragile as your Republic and Sith warriors. When we enter battle, we carry weapons powerful enough to pulverize cities.",
      "nm13aacand03026_.mp3": "Both in our wars, and in our own personal combats, there are no survivors. So Kolto does not hold the appeal it does for your peoples.",
      "nm13aacand03027_.mp3": "Well... It has big trees - in case your eyes don't work anymore. But I do know that there is one exceptional race on this world: the Wookiees.",
      "nm13aacand03028_.mp3": "The Wookiees, although primitive compared to us, are surprisingly capable warriors. They're pretty strong and pick up combat techniques pretty quick.",
      "nm13aacand03029_.mp3": "I think they're more than a match for the average Republic or Sith trooper. When we were looking for targets, we considered this world carefully.",
      "nm13aacand03030_.mp3": "We were wondering if we'd have to use larger weapons than our war droids if we wanted to clear the damn forests so we could fight in the open.",
      "nm13aacand03031_.mp3": "Too many trees means they can go into hiding too easy. And what's a continent or two turned to glass if we get the whole world after.",
      "nm13aacand03032_.mp3": "Tatooine is one big desert with rocks sticking out. I heard that some of my people came here after the war, but I don't know what happened to them.",
      "nm13aacand03033_.mp3": "The world of my clan - Ordo - was much like this. Dust basins and rock crags. But my world at least has some green around the equator - this place is just sand all over.",
      "nm13aacand03034_.mp3": "There are some vicious people on this world, but the desert is the real enemy. Trips out in the desert - especially the deep desert - should be taken very carefully.",
      "nm13aacand03035_.mp3": "Korriban is a Sith world, that's for sure. I mean, just look at this place.",
      "nm13aacand03036_.mp3": "When we were fighting with the Republic with the Sith, this was one of the major staging points for the invasion.",
      "nm13aacand03037_.mp3": "We were never allowed to land our troops on the world though, so we never knew what the Sith really do here.",
      "nm13aacand03038_.mp3": "Rumor has it that the leader of our clans at the time, Mandalore, did go down. They say the Sith perform terrible magics here.",
      "nm13aacand03039_.mp3": "This world is... odd. It looks like a battlefield, but the environment here is lush and green. Whatever happened here was a long time ago.",
      "nm13aacand03040_.mp3": "I have seen many strange worlds in my time, but this world is stranger still.",
      "nm13aacand03041_.mp3": "I don't like this place. Something happened... or is happening here and I don't like it. We should get out of here as soon as possible.",
      "nm13aacand03043_.mp3": "Ha! Stimulants make a warrior out of even the weakest human!",
      "nm13aacand03044_.mp3": "Here's a speed boosting stimulant to help you get quicker.",
      "nm13aacand03045_.mp3": "There anything else you need?",
      "nm13aacand03046_.mp3": "Here's a strength boosting stimulant to help you get stronger.",
      "nm13aacand03047_.mp3": "Here's a stamina boosting stimulant to help you get tougher.",
      "nm13aacand03048_.mp3": "Heh, don't worry I think you've got enough there as it is. You don't want to go overloading youself on stims, otherwise you might destroy your adrenal system.",
      "nm13aacand03049_.mp3": "A real warrior knows his own limits and doesn't overestimate himself.",
      "nm13aacand03051_.mp3": "You want to hear tales of my exploits? Of the wars I've seen and fought, the enemies I've seen die by my hand? Heh, sure, I'll humor you.",
      "nm13aacand03052_.mp3": "My name's Canderous of the Mandalorian clan Ordo. I've been fighting across the galaxy for 40 of your years.",
      "nm13aacand03053_.mp3": "For my people it's the honor and glory of battle that rules us. It's through combat that we prove our worth, gain renown and make our fortunes.",
      "nm13aacand03055_.mp3": "Times have changed now. The Mandalore clans have been scattered across the Outer Rim, the Republic is in decline and the Sith Empire rises to take its place.",
      "nm13aacand03056_.mp3": "The clans as they were aren't a threat, but the galaxy still fears us. Ha! People think we war out of spite, or bloodlust. They don't understand, and fear that.",
      "nm13aacand03057_.mp3": "We only wanted the challenge of the battle, and glory from it - win or lose. And we lost.",
      "nm13aacand03058_.mp3": "But now I have no real challenges. Crushing Davik's enemies and the pathetic gangs in the Lower City of Taris could not be considered the most glorious of tasks.",
      "nm13aacand03059_.mp3": "When I think of the battles I've fought... the thousands I've killed... the worlds I've burned... I weep for my past.",
      "nm13aacand03060_.mp3": "We'll never speak of this again. We've got work to do, so let's get to it.",
      "nm13aacand03062_.mp3": "The Sith came to us with an offer: to fight a worthy enemy in a battle that would be remembered forever.",
      "nm13aacand03064_.mp3": "Win or lose, as long as the fight is worthy, then honor is gained. The glory at having triumphed over impossible odds is what drives us.",
      "nm13aacand03065_.mp3": "If there's nothing at stake - your possessions, your life, your world - then the battle's meaningless.",
      "nm13aacand03066_.mp3": "We Mandalore take everything we are and throw it into battle. It's the true test of yourself - the battle against death... against oblivion.",
      "nm13aacand03068_.mp3": "All life dies eventually. A true warrior is one who can beat it down whenever it raises its head. But...",
      "nm13aacand03070_.mp3": "The days of combat and glory and cheating death at every turn seem to be over now... I take what I can.",
      "nm13aacand03072_.mp3": "I was one of the best youth warriors in clan Ordo in my time. No one before me had mastered the power of our Basilisk war droids as quickly as I had. Except Mandalore himself of course.",
      "nm13aacand03073_.mp3": "In those days we were sweeping across the Outer Rim. Destroying all who fought us.",
      "nm13aacand03074_.mp3": "Young Mandalores would prove themselves in real combat with unknown opponents above a thousand worlds. Each brought back the story of his achievements.",
      "nm13aacand03076_.mp3": "I remember it well, orbiting high above a placid world, its defenses just stirring. As was tradition, I would go ahead of the first wave to find enemies in the thickest fighting.",
      "nm13aacand03077_.mp3": "I remember sitting there in my armor, linked directly with the Basilisk thrumming beneath me. My heart racing with fear at the coming battle.",
      "nm13aacand03080_.mp3": "Every new warrior has to fear to understand how to beat it. You must know that.",
      "nm13aacand03081_.mp3": "The doors opened in front me and the air was sucked out of the drop bay, scattering crystals of frozen vapor across my path.",
      "nm13aacand03082_.mp3": "I can't describe what it feels like to look directly down at a world, falling continuously as you circle it, with barely fifteen centimeters of armor plate protecting you.",
      "nm13aacand03083_.mp3": "When the magnetic locks disengaged on my droid I plunged out of the drop bay towards the battle that waited below.",
      "nm13aacand03085_.mp3": "The exhilaration, the euphoria, I felt as I streaked into the atmosphere, dodging self-guided projectile and beam weapons, was unmatched.",
      "nm13aacand03086_.mp3": "A 80 kilometer plunge through the atmosphere, dodging and weaving, the outside of my armor glowing like the sun with the heat of re-entry.",
      "nm13aacand03087_.mp3": "And with barely thirty meters to spare, I twisted and skimmed the surface, firing at the giant beam generators that were in my path.",
      "nm13aacand03088_.mp3": "The explosion from that sent shockwaves that levelled the entire complex around it. It was the moment of my life.",
      "nm13aacand03090_.mp3": "I'll never forget those times. But... things are different now. We can't go on fighting the way we had. There are too few of us left now.",
      "nm13aacand03091_.mp3": "But I don't really want to talk about this anymore. I trust I've satisfied your curiosity for now?",
      "nm13aacand03092_.mp3": "Is there something else you want to know?",
      "nm13aacand03097_.mp3": "I don't remember. It doesn't matter anyway, that world's dead now.",
      "nm13aacand03100_.mp3": "Ha! We would travel from world to world, and descend on it in our Basilisk war droids. I still remember my first combat...",
      "nm13aacand03102_.mp3": "We were still recovering from the war we fought with the Sith. We were not yet strong enough to fight the Republic again. We needed to train another generation to do that.",
      "nm13aacand03103_.mp3": "You want another story, eh? You want to hear about some other world getting wasted? Heh, I knew you were the type.",
      "nm13aacand03104_.mp3": "Your stagnant Republic has never seen some of the strange creatures and races we fought on the Outer Rim in those years. Heh, and you never will now.",
      "nm13aacand03106_.mp3": "If a world isn't strong enough to defend itself, it's basically forfeit. But this story is about something a little different.",
      "nm13aacand03107_.mp3": "We were going through the asteroid fields of the Crispin system at the very edge of the galaxy, playing with the pirates and smugglers we found there.",
      "nm13aacand03108_.mp3": "The main belt in the Crispin system consists of mainly small rocks covered in frozen methane gas shells and the pirates were using them for cover.",
      "nm13aacand03109_.mp3": "Ha! I remember using a thermal generator to cause the outer layer of one of the asteroids to vaporize in a picosecond. It blew out and shredded the three smugglers using it for cover!",
      "nm13aacand03110_.mp3": "But... that was a mistake...",
      "nm13aacand03112_.mp3": "The asteroid I had targeted was smaller than most, maybe a dozen meters on a side. On the outside it looked the same as any other: just a ball covered in frozen gas.",
      "nm13aacand03113_.mp3": "But something must have been inside it... something inactive in the cold. The heat of my blast might have triggered something or woken something up.",
      "nm13aacand03114_.mp3": "After I had hit, spots of light and heat appeared all over the thin shell still covering it, evaporating the gases.",
      "nm13aacand03115_.mp3": "What lay underneath looked like some sort of rocky growth... a deformed rock pitted by scores of micrometeorite scars. I think something even older might have been inside that.",
      "nm13aacand03117_.mp3": "Maybe... but maybe not.",
      "nm13aacand03119_.mp3": "It started rotating - faster and faster as we watched it. After a second it started spraying fire - thermal projectiles that melted our armor like wax. We were caught completely by surprise.",
      "nm13aacand03120_.mp3": "Before we could counter-attack, it fled at an incredible speed.",
      "nm13aacand03122_.mp3": "We couldn't catch it, but we could follow its hyperspace wake.",
      "nm13aacand03123_.mp3": "We followed its trail as far as we could, heading away from the galactic core. When it finally led beyond the edge of our galaxy, we abandoned our efforts.",
      "nm13aacand03124_.mp3": "Anything that wants to commit suicide in that great void is not worth our trouble trying to catch.",
      "nm13aacand03125_.mp3": "That's the only story I have for now. I'll tell you some more stuff later, if we get the chance.",
      "nm13aacand03129_.mp3": "I don't have as many strange stories like the last one I told you, but I do have a couple about me and the stuff I've done.",
      "nm13aacand03130_.mp3": "In one battle above the world of Althir, my unit managed to defeat a force of Althiri ten times our own size. That battle gained me command of an entire sub-sect of my clan.",
      "nm13aacand03132_.mp3": "For five days they had managed to hold off our forces, keeping us to the outer rings of their world, preventing us from attacking it directly.",
      "nm13aacand03133_.mp3": "My task was to assault one of their flanks with a false attack. The Althiri would be drawn out by the units I had sent in.",
      "nm13aacand03134_.mp3": "Once they had surrounded those units, the bulk of my forces would attack from the rear and defeat them in detail.",
      "nm13aacand03136_.mp3": "Things did not go as I had planned. I saw an opening - a mistake they had made in the disposition of their forces - and took it!",
      "nm13aacand03137_.mp3": "While fending off our main force, they had let their fleet split in two! The center of their entire fleet was left exposed!",
      "nm13aacand03138_.mp3": "I turned my forces and assaulted the center of their fleet, decimating them!",
      "nm13aacand03140_.mp3": "Their slow, ponderous ship could not turn to face us without being overwhelmed. Their command vessels were destroyed in seconds. Their ranks were thrown into chaos.",
      "nm13aacand03141_.mp3": "It was most amusing to watch the surviving ships scatter and flee. Several even tried to dive through the plane of the rings to escape us!",
      "nm13aacand03142_.mp3": "They were shredded by the rings, or crashed into rocks, or were destroyed by our forces as we pursued them.",
      "nm13aacand03143_.mp3": "Warriors do not flee from a battle if they are losing. They fight to the end! As we did against you.",
      "nm13aacand03144_.mp3": "Warriors do not flee from a battle if they are losing. They fight to the end! As we did against your Jedi Revan.",
      "nm13aacand03145_.mp3": "Another time maybe I'll tell you about how the war with the Republic went. For now let's just get on with things.",
      "nm13aacand03147_.mp3": "This is a chance given to a warrior once or twice in a lifetime. The chance to change the course of history in a single act.",
      "nm13aacand03151_.mp3": "They weren't stupid. Stupid races don't make starships and weapons of mass destruction. But they weren't masters of the arts of war as Mandalorians are.",
      "nm13aacand03154_.mp3": "Ha! I was the best! Except for Mandalore of course. He was the only person alive except Revan who could have beat me.",
      "nm13aacand03155_.mp3": "Hm... I think I'll tell you a bit about the recent war we had with the Republic. That might be more familiar to you.",
      "nm13aacand03156_.mp3": "The one where you beat my people.",
      "nm13aacand03157_.mp3": "The one where the Jedi Revan beat my people.",
      "nm13aacand03158_.mp3": "We started by conquering worlds just outside the Republic. We did it quietly so the Republic wouldn't really know what was going on until too late.",
      "nm13aacand03159_.mp3": "When we finally did hit the Republic worlds, they had no idea we were coming.",
      "nm13aacand03160_.mp3": "We came in through three invasion corridors in adjacent sectors. Anyone who put up a fight - or wouldn't fight - was crushed. We razed whole worlds trying to provoke the Republic into fighting us.",
      "nm13aacand03161_.mp3": "I don't particularly enjoy wiping out worlds for its own sake, but the cowardly tactics the Republic defenders used left us little choice.",
      "nm13aacand03163_.mp3": "Hiding in the homes of civilians. Using families as shields. Thinking we would not use appropriate force on their bases inside major cities.",
      "nm13aacand03164_.mp3": "They underestimated our resolve and what measures are acceptable in war. Those who cannot defend themselves should not be around those who can in battle.",
      "nm13aacand03165_.mp3": "If annihilating a city is the kind of power it takes to overwhelm a Republic shield device, then that's what we did. Necessary force to destroy all opposition.",
      "nm13aacand03167_.mp3": "It's wrong to hide with shields surrounding you hoping the enemy will be so good as to throw themselves at your feet to be slaughtered!",
      "nm13aacand03168_.mp3": "I have no time or patience for cowards! They deserve to be hunted down and exterminated like vermin!",
      "nm13aacand03169_.mp3": "There was no honor in wiping them out like rats. But some of your forces did redeem the Republic in our eyes... especially later...",
      "nm13aacand03171_.mp3": "Later... when you had joined the war. We'll get back to that, we've wasted too much time already.",
      "nm13aacand03172_.mp3": "Later... when Revan had joined the war. But we'll get back to that, we've wasted too much time already.",
      "nm13aacand03179_.mp3": "They had the choice not to fight. We meet the enemy wherever they are hiding and we wipe them out. A few cities is a small price to pay for a world.",
      "nm13aacand03181_.mp3": "We fought against the Republic forces for some time, over the course of many battles.",
      "nm13aacand03182_.mp3": "At the start, they were not much of a threat to speak of, but once you had taken charge, things began to turn against us.",
      "nm13aacand03183_.mp3": "The Republic fleets began to use more than just basic tactics. Feints, counterattacks, mass deceptions. You were a genius on the field. You are held in very high regard among my people.",
      "nm13aacand03184_.mp3": "You abandoned worlds of their defenders so that others would be too fortified to strike. You made sacrifices in order to advance your goals. Such strategies had never been enough to best us before.",
      "nm13aacand03185_.mp3": "In the end, you proved too much for us.",
      "nm13aacand03187_.mp3": "There was no one else. The entire Republic had committed its forces behind you. The Sith had retreated back to their empire and there were none else strong enough to challenge us.",
      "nm13aacand03188_.mp3": "At the start, they were not much of a threat to speak of, but once the Jedi Revan had taken charge, things began to turn against us.",
      "nm13aacand03189_.mp3": "The Republic fleets began to use more than just basic tactics. Feints, counterattacks, mass deceptions. Revan was a genius on the field.",
      "nm13aacand03190_.mp3": "Revan abandoned worlds of their defenders so that others would be too fortified to strike, and was willing to make sacrifices in order to advance goals.",
      "nm13aacand03191_.mp3": "And in the end, Revan proved too much for us.",
      "nm13aacand03193_.mp3": "But it was close! So close!",
      "nm13aacand03195_.mp3": "There was no one else. The entire Republic had committed its forces behind Revan. The Sith had retreated back to their empire and there were none else strong enough to challenge us.",
      "nm13aacand03196_.mp3": "It looked like the entire galaxy was within our grasp!",
      "nm13aacand03197_.mp3": "I still remember that final battle in the skies above Malachor V. The two fleets filling the space around it, outshining the stars...",
      "nm13aacand03199_.mp3": "Yeah, we lost. But there is no shame in it. We lost to the greatest single warrior the Republic has ever known.",
      "nm13aacand03201_.mp3": "It was not your ships or your men or your vaunted 'fight for freedom' that won this, the final battle of the war.",
      "nm13aacand03202_.mp3": "It was by the actions of one person, the Jedi Revan, that you prevailed.",
      "nm13aacand03203_.mp3": "Revan's strategies and tactics defeated the best of us. Even Mandalore himself was taken aback by the ferocity, the tenacity and the subtlety of Revan's plans.",
      "nm13aacand03204_.mp3": "Revan fought us to a standstill and then began pushing back. We didn't really have a chance.",
      "nm13aacand03206_.mp3": "It was what we had wanted all along, in a way. We wanted to fight the best in a battle that would be remembered for centuries. And we did.",
      "nm13aacand03207_.mp3": "And Revan won.",
      "nm13aacand03208_.mp3": "I don't hold a grudge against Revan, and neither do any of my people. It was the greatest moment of my life to be in that battle.",
      "nm13aacand03209_.mp3": "If Revan had been a Mandalorian, nothing in the galaxy would have stopped us.",
      "nm13aacand03210_.mp3": "But wishing for the past to be different is useless. Better to look to the future. As we should now. We'll talk more later, I think.",
      "nm13aacand03213_.mp3": "And you won.",
      "nm13aacand03214_.mp3": "I hold no grudge against you, nor do any of my people. It was the greatest of honors to fight against you, even in defeat. It is even more of an honor to fight beside you now.",
      "nm13aacand03215_.mp3": "Had you been born of the Mandalorian clans, surely nothing in this galaxy would have been able to stop us.",
      "nm13aacand03217_.mp3": "Ha! Don't be naive. The Republic is not invincible. This battle was the end of the war, one way or another.",
      "nm13aacand03220_.mp3": "It was by the actions of one person - you - that the Republic prevailed.",
      "nm13aacand03221_.mp3": "Your strategies and tactics defeated the best we could send against you. Even Mandalore himself was taken aback by the ferocity of your attacks, the tenacity of your defenses and the subtleties of your plans.",
      "nm13aacand03222_.mp3": "You fought us to a standstill and then began pushing back. We didn't really have a chance.",
      "nm13aacand03224_.mp3": "The Sith had gone - retreated into their empire. They sealed themselves off from the rest of the galaxy. We thought it would be centuries before they'd come back.",
      "nm13aacand03225_.mp3": "It's amazing that they could rebuild their fleet so fast. But at the time, it looked like the galaxy was in our grasp!",
      "nm13aacand03228_.mp3": "The war we had with the Republic was supposed to be the most glorious battle of our history, but... it was a very costly one. I guess we didn't think of how much we could lose in it.",
      "nm13aacand03231_.mp3": "There weren't many of us left after that last battle. Mandalore himself was killed at the hands of the Jedi Revan. The best of us could not defeat him!",
      "nm13aacand03232_.mp3": "After that last battle, those of us that survived were stripped of our weapons, our armor, and our Basilisks.",
      "nm13aacand03233_.mp3": "Revan's forces destroyed them while we were forced to watch. Those who hadn't fled earlier were left with nothing to call their own: no weapons, no armor... only the honor of having fought in the battle we just lost.",
      "nm13aacand03234_.mp3": "For many this was not enough. While the rest of us were sent into exile on the Outer Rim, they tried to relive the old days - raiding worlds. They're nothing more than bandits now.",
      "nm13aacand03236_.mp3": "Yeah, I came to Taris.",
      "nm13aacand03237_.mp3": "Enforcing for Davik was not... stimulating. The gangs on Taris and Davik's rivals were trash. They give no thrill in battle, no honor or glory in defeating them. It was like stepping on bugs.",
      "nm13aacand03238_.mp3": "I sought worthy challenges, but the best that Taris could offer were nothing to me.",
      "nm13aacand03239_.mp3": "But I think now - with you - I may finally find opponents worth fighting.",
      "nm13aacand03243_.mp3": "Maybe it'll happen, maybe it won't. Either way, I think that by following you I can get something out of it.",
      "nm13aacand03244_.mp3": "Maybe later I'll tell you more about what it was like to work for Davik. For now, though, we should get on with our lives.",
      "nm13aacand03246_.mp3": "Yeah. I found work on Taris.",
      "nm13aacand03247_.mp3": "The Republic's forces destroyed them while we were forced to watch. Those who hadn't fled earlier were left with nothing to call their own: no weapons, no armor... only the honor of having fought in the battle we just lost.",
      "nm13aacand03249_.mp3": "Yeah... yeah you did. You were a great warrior Revan. A great general.",
      "nm13aacand03251_.mp3": "Working for Davik was like driving a spike through the side of your head... Sure you get something new in there, but in the end, you've lost something as well.",
      "nm13aacand03252_.mp3": "Beating up people who wouldn't - or couldn't - pay, strong-arming his competitors, killing who he said. It was busy work, nothing decent.",
      "nm13aacand03254_.mp3": "Assassin. Mercenary. Those are names people give guys like me who do the killing to make us seem better or worse in their eyes.",
      "nm13aacand03256_.mp3": "I've killed many people. I can't say I'm proud of it, but I have. Criminals, competitors, businessmen, police... women, children...",
      "nm13aacand03257_.mp3": "Jedi were a better challenge, but they hardly ever poked around in the Under City.",
      "nm13aacand03258_.mp3": "... Until you came along...",
      "nm13aacand03259_.mp3": "But I never wanted to challenge you. Never felt the need. Maybe I knew I couldn't win... just like all those years ago.",
      "nm13aacand03261_.mp3": "Yeah, probably. Heh. You'd likely have beaten me again.",
      "nm13aacand03263_.mp3": "Maybe you would have. But you're not who you were back then, I can tell. You've changed... and maybe I have too.",
      "nm13aacand03264_.mp3": "I remember a time when I could do anything I wanted... Kill, maim, murder... It was all the same to me.",
      "nm13aacand03265_.mp3": "But now... now that I'm older, I can look back and regret...",
      "nm13aacand03267_.mp3": "In a Mandalorian... I'm not even sure what that is anymore. The Mandalorian are gone, defeated by the Republic and swept away by time.",
      "nm13aacand03268_.mp3": "I look back and regret all the chances I had as a warrior, and then all the chances I've had since then. I shouldn't be getting like this, not when so many other things are happening... but...",
      "nm13aacand03269_.mp3": "It feels like... like something has changed inside and I don't know what it is. Bah! This is unbecoming of a warrior! Let's get on with everything before I start getting sentimental or something.",
      "nm13aacand03272_.mp3": "Ha! Good one. That's like a warrior should. Like what you see in a Mandalorian.",
      "nm13aacand03274_.mp3": "Maybe...",
      "nm13aacand03276_.mp3": "I'm not happy with the way my life has turned. I'm not the Mandalore I once was. I don't even think I'm the merc I was when I joined you.",
      "nm13aacand03277_.mp3": "I think... I think I need something more than killing and fighting in my life. I need a purpose or something like that.",
      "nm13aacand03279_.mp3": "The way the Mandalorians - we - fought... it holds no appeal for me. To rape and ravage worlds for the thrill of battle... It gets old. Very old.",
      "nm13aacand03280_.mp3": "Honor in battle. Cheating death. Comrades in arms. The code of the Mandalore.",
      "nm13aacand03281_.mp3": "I think I'm something different now. Maybe more, maybe less. ",
      "nm13aacand03283_.mp3": "No... The time of the clans is past. I don't think the galaxy wants them anymore. Maybe in the future, but not now.",
      "nm13aacand03284_.mp3": "Once my time with you is done, once you have moved on to greater things, I'll find my own way once again.",
      "nm13aacand03285_.mp3": "Maybe the Mandalorian clans will be reborn again. Maybe even under the Republic... or the Sith.",
      "nm13aacand03286_.mp3": "But dreaming about the future is stupid right now. We should get down to our business and finish it. If we survive all this... maybe we could talk about it then.",
      "nm13aacand03288_.mp3": "I don't think there is really any place left in the galaxy for the Mandalorian clans like they were. I don't know if I can go on forever fighting as I have. Even warriors get insightful in their old age...",
      "nm13aacand03290_.mp3": "Killing is never enough. Anybody can kill just by pushing a button. A warrior fights his battles himself - as you have done - and tries to defeat all comers.",
      "nm13aacand03293_.mp3": "This thing with Jagi... I... I don't know. Give me some time and I'll be able to sort this out on my own.",
      "nm13aacand03294_.mp3": "Is there something else you wanted?",
      "nm13aacand03296_.mp3": "Your choice. I'm here if you want something done right.",
      "nm13aacand03297_.mp3": "What? You think I don't have something better to do?",
      "nm13aacand03298_.mp3": "So deal with it. Why are you asking me about it?",
      "nm13aacrat07050_.mp3": "They are the scum who could not stand defeat and fled the final battles. They do us no credit.",
      "nm13aacrat07086_.mp3": "Ha! Good to see things in this Jedi enclave work just like they do out in the real world. Everyone's looking out for number one.",
      "nm13aaelis08018_.mp3": "Ha! I guess that droid is really going to to serve his master tonight!",
      "nm13aajagi08001_.mp3": "You brought some of your own as well.",
      "nm13aajagi08012_.mp3": "This is a matter of honor. I cannot stand by this insult. I must do this.",
      "nm13aajagi08014_.mp3": "He has slandered me and questioned my honor. Among the Mandalore, many have died for much lesser insults.",
      "nm13aajagi08020_.mp3": "If I had not attacked when I did, the battle would not have been won so easily!",
      "nm13aajagi08022_.mp3": "That's not the way it happened...",
      "nm13aajagi08024_.mp3": "The Althiri were fighting hard. I saw a break in their defenses that left their center exposed. I had to take the chance.",
      "nm13aajagi08025_.mp3": "If I had not done what I did, many more warriors would have died and the battle would have taken much longer. I stand by my decision.",
      "nm13aajagi08027_.mp3": "I... I can regret their loss, but it was necessary.",
      "nm13aajagi08038_.mp3": "I saw a chance and had to take it. It ended the battle quicker than we would have otherwise, and many of our warriors may have died.",
      "nm13aajagi08039_.mp3": "Mandalore taught us that opportunism and flexibility in battle were to be admired. You may contradict me, but do you contradict him as well?",
      "nm13aajagi08043_.mp3": "And so it shall be.",
      "nm13aajagi08047_.mp3": "At the cost of our lives? He may have saved others in the long run, but... but...",
      "nm13aajagi08049_.mp3": "I saw my chance to end the battle quickly and I took it. I regret the men I lost, but it was necessary.",
      "nm13aajagi08051_.mp3": "We must.",
      "nm13aajagi08056_.mp3": "No! Do not alter his mind to defend me! I can fight my own battles without your help!",
      "nm13aajagi08070_.mp3": "He... he was a warrior under my command up to the battle of Althir. But I thought...",
      "nm13aajagi08073_.mp3": "You broke from the battle plan and let us die for it, so that you could have the 'honor' of being the first to the enemy commander!",
      "nm13aajagi08075_.mp3": "I... I did what was prudent at the time. If I had not done it, the battle would have....",
      "nm13aajagi08094_.mp3": "This concerns my employer as well.",
      "nm13aajuha11019_.mp3": "You can't expect everything to get handed to you on a silver platter.",
      "nm13aajuha11028_.mp3": "Giving you a second chance like this is a clear sign of weakness. Sometimes I find it hard to believe the Jedi could defeat my people in battle.",
      "nm13aavand17090_.mp3": "And they beat my people so easily in battle...",
      "nm13aavand17104_.mp3": "These raiders are a disgrace. No true Mandalorian would stoop to raiding farms when whole worlds were open to them.",
      "nm13aavroo18024_.mp3": "The Jedi Revan was a great warrior and a amazing general. Even Mandalore himself couldn't defeat him.",
      "nm14aaelis09011_.mp3": "Ha! Better get used to it, droid!",
      "nm14aajon006004_.mp3": "You should have protected her better. And you call yourself her father.",
      "nm14aajon006054_.mp3": "Practical.",
      "nm14aanemo07043_.mp3": "You Republics are too weak. You should protect what you want to keep, otherwise someone stronger will take it.",
      "nm14aasett11023_.mp3": "He should have been protecting her better if he wanted to keep her.",
      "nm14aasett11033_.mp3": "They're pathetic. They're taking scraps when they should be taking worlds.",
      "nm14abahla01011_.mp3": "At least you're efficient.",
      "nm14abmdro03010_.mp3": "And don't think I wouldn't enjoy blowing you to bits.",
      "nm14abmdro03028_.mp3": "So this is how nobles show their gratitude. No wonder all my friends are soldiers.",
      "nm14achand05076_.mp3": "Well, if you can't keep her, it's your own fault.",
      "nm14acrick08056_.mp3": "Echanis make delicate weapons with too little firepower. Lightweight stuff, if you ask me.",
      "nm14acsher09004_.mp3": "Now this is what I've been waiting for!",
      "nm16aanuri01008_.mp3": "This guy isn't telling us something... he might even be lying. I don't trust him.",
      "nm16aaraha02037_.mp3": "There could be a lot of money for finding Shen Matale. I think that girl knows something about him going missing.",
      "nm17aa03sh01067_.mp3": "Back off, old man. I thought you were the non-involved type, remember?",
      "nm17aa03sh01156_.mp3": "The role of the weak is to serve the will of the strong; I'm glad you understand that.",
      "nm17aa03sh01163_.mp3": "What was that all about? Are you going soft on me?",
      "nm17ae04ce02053_.mp3": "Never underestimate a Mandalorian. If I want, there won't be enough of you left to identify.",
      "nm17ae04ce02082_.mp3": "Never underestimate a Mandalorian. If I want, there won't be enough of you left to identify.",
      "nm17ae04ce02106_.mp3": "Money's honest, old man. More honest than a conniving Jedi.",
      "nm17ae04ga03062_.mp3": "Shaking people down for petty credits. Reminds me of my days working for Davik.",
      "nm18ackoma99133_.mp3": "We Mandalorians believe in loyalty to our brothers-in-arms. You have allied yourself to this hunter; betraying him now is disgraceful!",
      "nm18acstar99008_.mp3": "Anybody else get the feeling that finding this Star Map in the back of this krayt dragon's cave is more than just a coincidence?",
      "nm18acstar99009_.mp3": "Now that we've got what we came for we should probably move on. Can't say I'm going to miss this pit of a world.",
      "nm22aadaso07062_.mp3": "If it had been me, Eli would a smoking corpse right now.",
      "nm22aajano06059_.mp3": "Maybe you should start talking, or I might decide to get a little... restless.",
      "nm22aazaal01060_.mp3": "Hmph. Maybe we should have brought the Wookiee out. This place looks... untamed.",
      "nm22abdehn06055_.mp3": "And who are you to stop us, little man?",
      "nm23acworr01040_.mp3": "At least he's going to die like a warrior.",
      "nm23acworr01140_.mp3": "Yeah, let's keep the focus on what's important. If there's profit to be made here, we don't want to miss out.",
      "nm23adchuu01072_.mp3": "My, my. Best to give an angry Wookiee his due, I'd say.",
      "nm23adchuu01074_.mp3": "Getting Wookiees angry is not a smart thing to do.",
      "nm23adchuu01147_.mp3": "Heh, now this is going to hurt some...",
      "nm23adchuu01256_.mp3": "Let's go kill something and get the Wookiee out.",
      "nm23adfrey02066_.mp3": "Don't push him too much or we'll have a berserk Wookiee on our hands...",
      "nm24aagorw04010_.mp3": "Now this is what I live for!",
      "nm25aacomp01254_.mp3": "You blew that one, didn't you? Basic military strategy requires sacrifices. I thought you'd know that.",
      "nm25aahurt03068_.mp3": "They were Mandalorian. Poachers, probably. They use stealth units to stalk their prey. Their kind were among the first to flee when the war turned against my people. Bloody cowards.",
      "nm25aamand04008_.mp3": "More than a threat enough for you!",
      "nm25aastar99008_.mp3": "What good is a Star Map buried at the bottom of the damn Shadowlands? Nobody'd ever find it here, so what's the point?",
      "nm25aastar99009_.mp3": "I suppose if the Star Map is as old as everyone seems to think it could have been here before all these damn trees. It's just hard to imagine.",
      "nm25aastar99029_.mp3": "But I don't want to stand around here chatting about this. Too many spots for an ambush. We've got what we came for - let's just head back to the treetops.",
      "nm26aaechm03011_.mp3": "We're wasting our time with this prancing Echani.",
      "nm26aaechm03015_.mp3": "Your protection didn't help much when my brothers slaughtered your warriors by the thousands during the Mandalorian Wars!",
      "nm26aaechm03019_.mp3": "See - I told you we were just wasting our time here.",
      "nm26aairim06063_.mp3": "Sounds like a recruiting drive to me. We used to use it on planets we had conquered. Get 'em while they're young and impressionable.",
      "nm26aamanm07000_.mp3": "Canderous! I haven't seen you since the Republic broke our ranks at the battle of Malachor!",
      "nm26aamanm07002_.mp3": "Ergeron, I see you've got some new guns to add to your collection. Times must have been profitable for you since the war.",
      "nm26aamanm07004_.mp3": "Very profitable. When the Republic defeated our fleets, I learned a valuable lesson: it's far better to be a freelance mercenary in a war than to be a soldier for the losing side.",
      "nm26aamanm07006_.mp3": "So the Sith smoked a Jedi outpost on Dantooine. No survivors, or so they say. First Taris, now Dantooine. Wouldn't surprise me if the Republic starts hiring mercs to make a counter attack.",
      "nm26aamanm07008_.mp3": "They might even hire some Echani or Iridorian mercenaries, if they're desperate. I bet a Mandalorian could make some good money working for the Republic right now.",
      "nm26aamanm07009_.mp3": "All of a sudden the Republic isn't hiring mercenaries anymore.",
      "nm26aamanm07011_.mp3": "And now the kolto harvest is at an all time low. More than just coincidence, if you ask me.",
      "nm26aamanm07012_.mp3": "If you're here to offer me a job, I'm not interested right now. I've got so many offers I can't keep up as it is. ",
      "nm26aamanm07014_.mp3": "Maybe that Iridorian skullslacker at the bar, or the Echani nerfherder cowering in the corner is available.",
      "nm26aamanm07016_.mp3": "Normally I'd charge you for information, but times are good right now and I'm feeling generous. So ask your questions, free of charge.",
      "nm26aamanm07018_.mp3": "Not really. They say some Republic war hero killed her. Maybe you should check out the Republic Embassy.",
      "nm26aamanm07020_.mp3": "If there ever were any ruins on this world, they've long since disappeared beneath the oceans.",
      "nm26aamanm07022_.mp3": "Not really. I have no interest in the Selkath other than the fact that they are charging me an exorbitant amount to stay on this world.",
      "nm26aamanm07024_.mp3": "The Iridorian over there, however... He, I believe, may know more. He has been seen with several of them before.",
      "nm26aamanm07026_.mp3": "Nothing, except the Echani are a bunch of fey dancers, prancing into battle with tiny weapons not fit for Mandalorian children. They hardly wear any armor because it slows them down when they run away. ",
      "nm26aamanm07028_.mp3": "But the Echani are better than the Iridorians. Those savages keep hacking at fallen foe even after death, mutilating the corpse out of pure blood lust.",
      "nm26aamanm07030_.mp3": "I even heard they'll turn on each other when the battle fever hits. Who wants to work with someone like that? I can pretty much name my price right now, especially since the Republic is so desperate for mercs all of a sudden.",
      "nm26aamanm07032_.mp3": "They ain't saying, but the price sure is right. Of course, I haven't heard of anyone coming back, so I'm guessing the job ain't easy.",
      "nm26aamanm07034_.mp3": "I'm a realist. It was war, after all. And even though the Republic destroyed my people, the leaders of the armada were Revan and Malak, so I hate the Sith just as much.",
      "nm26aamanm07036_.mp3": "And with this war, there's plenty of opportunity to take bloody vengeance against both sides and make a nice profit along the way. We Mandalorians are always practical. Not like those blood-thirsty Iridorians, or those honor-bound Echani.",
      "nm26aamanm07038_.mp3": "Is there anything else you want?",
      "nm26aamanm07040_.mp3": "So why are you telling me? If you're going, go. I don't need a status report.",
      "nm26aatria27517_.mp3": "This is why we Mandalorians don't have courts. We prefer to settle things with trial by combat.",
      "nm26aatria27521_.mp3": "I guess you got the result you wanted, but I still think this was a big waste of time. We Mandalorians prefer to settle things with a nice, quick trial by combat.",
      "nm27aasith07014_.mp3": "Let's bring this on!",
      "nm28aamerc03034_.mp3": "Don't get your hopes up too high. I have no intention of dying.",
      "nm28absur201010_.mp3": "Doesn't smell so bad to me, old man.",
      "nm28absur201026_.mp3": "Psychotic fish just don't try to dodge as much.",
      "nm33aalash11004_.mp3": "You should turn around and move along, kid. You don't want the trouble we'd give you.",
      "nm33aalash11012_.mp3": "You couldn't find your backside with both hands AND your friends'.",
      "nm33aalash11040_.mp3": "It would be more realistic if the commander just shot them both.",
      "nm33aalash11063_.mp3": "Nice one, old man.",

      "nm39aastar99000_.mp3": "It smells like death here. Not good, honest battlefield death, but a musty, wasting death. Figures we'd find one of these Star Maps in a place like this.",

      "nm40aabast01072_.mp3": "Don't you worry about that. I know how to deal with the guards. They won't know what hit them! ",
      "nm40aacand04000_.mp3": "This is Canderous. We're at the Ebon Hawk. Like we figured, it's under heavy guard. But don't worry... we'll figure out a plan to take care of them.",
      "nm40aacart05056_.mp3": "You could give me a shot to delay my healing mods from kicking in. A small incendiary grenade will leave burn marks that look like I was injured while making repairs to the ship.",
      "nm40aacart05058_.mp3": "Make my wounds bad enough and the Sith'll drag me off to the morgue or the medical facility to die. When my healing mods kick in I'll come save the rest of you.",

      "nm40aacart05063_.mp3": "I'll go into the Ebon Hawk's armory and give myself that shot right now. The plating on the doors back there will keep the rest of you safe from the grenade explosion.",
      "nm40accand02000_.mp3": "It's Canderous. We took care of the guards. We're inside the Ebon Hawk and all systems are go. As soon as you guys join us we can get out of here.",

      "nm40adcart01062_.mp3": "Whatever you are fighting, it will be worthy of my skill. I'm your man until the end, Revan, no matter how this plays out.",
      "nm40adcart01087_.mp3": "Remember we're talking about the Force, here. At this point Malak himself could drop out of the sky and I wouldn't bat an eyelash.",

      "nm38abjora02089_.mp3": "And so we come to round two. You come across a group of humans who are threatened by dangerous animals. They plead for help, offering you a reward. What do you do?",
      "nm38abjora02091_.mp3": "So you've made a profit and now have some sniveling, useless fools trailing after you. No, no, no. Bad idea. Bad idea.",
      "nm38abjora02093_.mp3": "At any rate... here is your punishment.",
      "nm38abjora02096_.mp3": "Correct! The humans would no doubt just be preyed upon by something else, later. Stand up for yourself, I say! We're not Jedi shepherds, after all.",

      "nm38abjora02100_.mp3": "Let's see... ah, yes. You discover an aspect of the Force that gives you great power. Do you share it and strengthen the Sith as a whole or keep it to yourself?",
      "nm38abjora02102_.mp3": "Correct! Let them rip the secret from your cold, dead hands... if they are strong enough. Oh, certainly, you might share it with a few... selected... minions, but that of course is a completely different story. Ha ha!",
      "nm38abjora02104_.mp3": "Well, it's sad to say, but it's that time again, Mekel.",
      "nm38abjora02106_.mp3": "Will you look at that? Poor Mekel has gone and died on us. Tsk tsk. And here I thought he was good for at least one more.",
      "nm38abjora02108_.mp3": "Still going? Alright, then. One of your underlings has made a major mistake which makes you look bad. He is normally very competent and skilled. Do you kill him or give him another chance?",
      "nm38abjora02110_.mp3": "Correct! Publicly, if you can. There is no room for that level of failure. Not killing him would be seen as a sign of weakness... and then where would you be?",
      "nm38abjora02112_.mp3": "Ahhh, Mekel. The time has come once again, hasn't it?",
      "nm38abjora02114_.mp3": "Last question! You're about to die. Do you pass on your knowledge to your apprentice to make him stronger... or do you use your last breath to strike at your enemies?",
      "nm38abjora02116_.mp3": "What?! How did you know that? That was my trick question! Bah! Telepathy. No, wait! Someone told you didn't they!",

      "nm38abjora02124_.mp3": "I'll just give you my tablet. Perhaps we'll meet again... Sith. That would be fun, no?",
      "nm38abjora02126_.mp3": "Now... this is odd. The test is over and you're both still alive. Well that's never happened before. Hmmmn. What to do, what to do...",
      "nm38abjora02128_.mp3": "I suppose this means you can go, Mekel. I'll have to just figure out what to do with our friend, here. Run along, now.",

      "nm38abjora02174_.mp3": "Ahhh, what's a little mental instability between tutor and pupil? What's important is that I'm here to better the Sith as a whole. It's a big job.",
      "nm38abjora02176_.mp3": "Ha ha ha! I maaay do that. In time, in time. But for now, I've decided to keep you in restraints. No point in you getting strange ideas in your head and ruining my fun.",

      "nm33abmeke02038_.mp3": "Good. I don't want to miss this for anything, heh...",
      "nm35aautha22000_.mp3": "Ahhh... what is this you bring me, Shaardan?",
      "nm35aautha22001_.mp3": "It is none other than the sword of Ajunta Pall, Master.",
      "nm35aautha22004_.mp3": "There is no place for fools amongst the Sith. Begone.",
      "nm35aautha22005_.mp3": "Your destiny lies elsewhere, young one, not with the Sith... at least, not yet. Go... and return another time, if you still wish to.",
      "nm35aautha22006_.mp3": "Greetings, prospective students. It appears we have a late entry. Who do you bring before me, Yuthura? A young human, bristling with the Force?",
      "nm35aautha22010_.mp3": "That I'll judge for myself, thank you. Tell me, human... what do you know of the ways of the Sith? What preconceptions has your mind been polluted with?",
      "nm35aautha22012_.mp3": "Indeed? Then perhaps you would care to demonstrate for us the powers of a Sith Master. ...No? Then perhaps you shall keep your foolishness to yourself and actually learn something.",
      "nm35aautha22014_.mp3": "A diplomatic answer, if not the core of the matter. Our power is obvious. The question in truth goes much deeper than the surface.",
      "nm35aautha22016_.mp3": "An honest answer, and one I would expect from anyone who has been exposed to those sad relics amongst the Jedi. As always, young human, the truth is not quite so simple.",
      "nm35aautha22018_.mp3": "Untrue. The Force demands discipline from all who use it, and the Sith demand duty. The truth goes far beyond such a superficial evaluation.",
      "nm35aautha22020_.mp3": "Most impressive, if it is true. Those who were too weak to stand against you deserved their fate, so expect no retribution from us. There is much you can learn from the Sith, and we from you.",
      "nm35aautha22022_.mp3": "An honest if evasive answer. Likely it is more true than you realize. Allow me to speak of the deeper matters at hand.",
      "nm35aautha22023_.mp3": "The Jedi equate the light with goodness and strength and the dark with weakness and evil. That is their tradition and it is truly no surprise that they cling to it for comfort.",
      "nm35aautha22024_.mp3": "We, however, do not treat the Force as a burden. We treat it as a gift, a thing to be celebrated. We use it to acquire power over others... and why should we not? Because the Jedi say we should not?",
      "nm35aautha22025_.mp3": "We are as the Force is meant to be. The Jedi would hide that from you... they would tell you the dark side is too quick, too easy, all so that they need never challenge the passions that lie within them.",
      "nm35aautha22026_.mp3": "Joining with us means realizing your true potential. It means not stifling yourself solely for the sake of hide-bound shamans and their antiquated notion of order. Be what you were meant to be.",
      "nm35aautha22027_.mp3": "What say you, Lashowe? Are you ready to learn the secrets of the dark side? Dare you?",
      "nm35aautha22029_.mp3": "Brash and fiery, as expected. Turn that passion to your advantage, child. What of you, Mekel? Are you ready?",
      "nm35aautha22030_.mp3": "I am, Master. More than ready.",
      "nm35aautha22031_.mp3": "I sense much anger within you, young one. That is good. That will provide you power. And Shaardan... what of you?",
      "nm35aautha22032_.mp3": "I am always ready!",
      "nm35aautha22033_.mp3": "I see. You had best gather your wits for the trial ahead, boy, or you will not last.",
      "nm35aautha22034_.mp3": "And you, young human? Does this interest you? Are you ready to learn more of what I speak?",
      "nm35aautha22036_.mp3": "Your slaves? They are irrelevant. They may accompany you, so long as they do not interfere with us or with your training. Are you ready or not, young one?",
      "nm35aautha22038_.mp3": "And so shall it be.",
      "nm35aautha22039_.mp3": "Now, then. All of you five recruits have shown a degree of facility with the Force... you all have the potential to become true Sith. Only one of you, however, will succeed.",
      "nm35aautha22040_.mp3": "The one who succeeds will be admitted to the academy as a full Sith. All others must wait until next year and try again... if you survive.",
      "nm35aautha22041_.mp3": "My pupil, Yuthura, shall be your teacher and master while you attempt to prove yourselves. Heed her words.",
      "nm35aautha22044_.mp3": "If you wish to gain a lead over your competitors, the first of you to learn the Code of the Sith and tell me of it will be rewarded.",
      "nm35aautha22045_.mp3": "The rest is for you to discover. Welcome to the dark side, my children... your one chance at true greatness lies here.",
      "nm35aautha22046_.mp3": "Are you? I can see into your heart, young human, and I see the dark kernel that is there. If it is ready to sprout remains to be seen.",
      "nm35aautha22048_.mp3": "An honest answer. You will make little progress, however, if you do not come to learn that any opportunity, even an unsure one, must be snatched.",
      "nm35aautha22050_.mp3": "Ha ha ha! You are brave to argue, young one. I have met few students who would speak so openly to me.",
      "nm35aautha22051_.mp3": "Ask yourself first what this 'morality' is? How is it created? Who does it benefit? Where do your notions of 'good' and 'evil' come from?",
      "nm35aautha22052_.mp3": "You may come to the realization that morality is but an obstacle to overcome... or not. The discovery is yours to make, should you be ready.",
      "nm35aautha22053_.mp3": "So, then. I take it you are ready to travel to the tomb of Naga Sadow? Your final test should not be delayed.",
      "nm35aautha22055_.mp3": "It is a tomb that belonged to an ancient Sith Lord... the greatest of Korriban's Sith Lords, in fact. It is there that your test is performed.",
      "nm35aautha22057_.mp3": "I will tell you the details when we are there, young one. You will, however, fight for your life... that is why I suggest you be in sufficient health.",
      "nm35aautha22059_.mp3": "Then we go now.",
      "nm35aautha22061_.mp3": "Then return when you are. Do not delay overly long, young one.",
      "nm35aautha22062_.mp3": "Do not forget our agreement regarding Yuthura's treachery. We shall put her in her place... should you reach the final test, that is.",
      "nm35aautha22063_.mp3": "Greetings, young one. You have much to do, yet... you have gained little prestige. You will have to work quickly if you hope to best the others.",
      "nm35aautha22065_.mp3": "Oh? It is no more complicated than I said. Perform impressive deeds or bring me a suitably valuable artifact from the Valley of the Dark Lords.",
      "nm35aautha22074_.mp3": "There is an exit that leads to the surface of the planet... the valley is only a short trip from there. It is not difficult to find.",
      "nm35aautha22076_.mp3": "You wish to know more about me, do you? And why would I indulge your idle curiosity? Will we be good friends, you think?",
      "nm35aautha22077_.mp3": "I strived many years to hone my power until I was able to drive out my predecessor and rule the academy. If you are smart, you will aim to do the same, or better.",
      "nm35aautha22078_.mp3": "There is nothing else that you need to know. Do not ask again, young one.",
      "nm35aautha22080_.mp3": "Oh? What is my apprentice up to now?",
      "nm35aautha22082_.mp3": "I see. It is good that you have come to me with this information, young one.",
      "nm35aautha22083_.mp3": "It is a bit... ironic... that Yuthura has begun her plotting. I have been aware of her growing ambitions for some time, and had in fact already decided to remove her.",
      "nm35aautha22084_.mp3": "Normally, the one who gains the most prestige would engage in a final trial... two of the students would fight. This time it will be Yuthura who battles, though she does not know it.",
      "nm35aautha22085_.mp3": "Perhaps it will be you who combats her? Yes... perhaps so. This is what you can do. Give this pad to Adrenas... he will put some poison in her bath.",
      "nm35aautha22086_.mp3": "This will weaken Yuthura for that final test, making her an easy target. Rather generous of me, don't you think?",
      "nm35aautha22089_.mp3": "For coming to me with this information and betraying your foolish trainer, I feel you are worthy of prestige, young one.",
      "nm35aautha22090_.mp3": "Go, now... you have not yet impressed me enough to declare you the victor. I have matters to attend to.",
      "nm35aautha22094_.mp3": "A student, is it? What might you have to say?",
      "nm35aautha22096_.mp3": "Ahhhh. I think I know this one you speak of. You gained his confidence to admit such, did you?",
      "nm35aautha22097_.mp3": "I commend your competitive spirit... you have certainly impressed me. I shall speak to the boy straight away.",
      "nm35aautha22098_.mp3": "You have impressed me enough, by my estimation, to become a Sith in full. Congratulations, young one... you have bested the others quite completely.",
      "nm35aautha22099_.mp3": "You have but one final test which you must take, and this requires us to travel to the tomb of Naga Sadow in the Valley of the Dark Lords.",
      "nm35aautha22100_.mp3": "I would advise you to be rested and equipped before we leave. Return to your quarters now and seek me out in the morning.",
      "nm35aautha22101_.mp3": "When you return, make sure that you have all that you will need... for you will face your test alone. Go, and may the Force serve you well.",
      "nm35aautha22102_.mp3": "Go, now... you have done well, but you have not impressed me enough to declare you the victor. I have matters to attend to.",
      "nm35aautha22104_.mp3": "I see. Then leave me be if you have nothing to offer. I am sure you have much to do.",
      "nm35aautha22106_.mp3": "Then finish the Code as I speak it.",
      "nm35aautha22107_.mp3": "\"Peace is a lie, there is only...\"",
      "nm35aautha22111_.mp3": "\"Through passion I gain...\"",
      "nm35aautha22113_.mp3": "\"Through strength I gain...\"",
      "nm35aautha22116_.mp3": "\"Through power I gain...\"",
      "nm35aautha22119_.mp3": "\"Through victory....\"",
      "nm35aautha22124_.mp3": "\"The Force shall free me.\"",
      "nm35aautha22125_.mp3": "Yes, good. You have, indeed, learned the Code of the Sith. Speaking the words and knowing the words are, however, two different things.",
      "nm35aautha22126_.mp3": "Tell me, then, true or false: it is our passion that fuels the Force.",
      "nm35aautha22128_.mp3": "Well done. I will test you no more... you know the Code. Very impressive.",
      "nm35aautha22130_.mp3": "No, it is true. Our passion, our hate and desire... that is what brings conflict, which gives us power.",
      "nm35aautha22131_.mp3": "Sadly, it seems you did not understand the Code as well as I thought.",
      "nm35aautha22132_.mp3": "Tell me then, true or false: there is nothing worse than love.",
      "nm35aautha22134_.mp3": "False. Mercy is worse than love.",
      "nm35aautha22136_.mp3": "Tell me then, true or false: victory by any means is desirable.",
      "nm35aautha22138_.mp3": "False. Unless victory proves your superiority, it is an illusion, it is temporary.",
      "nm35aautha22145_.mp3": "No. No, that is incorrect. I would have thought merely reciting the Code to be a simple matter. Ah, well.",
      "nm35aautha22146_.mp3": "\"When you act, strike once and stike hard as if it were your last. Therein lies victory.\" Another of our proverbs. Go and find some other means to gain prestige, young one.",
      "nm35aautha22148_.mp3": "Ahhh. The ones I ordered executed for their mutiny? It's done, then?",
      "nm35aautha22150_.mp3": "Indeed. I had the caverns checked after you left. Well done.",
      "nm35aautha22151_.mp3": "The lesson is learned, I believe.",
      "nm35aautha22153_.mp3": "[Success] Indeed? We checked the caves and found only a couple of bodies. Perhaps the shyrack ate them? Ah, it is just as good, I suppose.",
      "nm35aautha22156_.mp3": "Ahhh, finally, the genuine sword! I knew that this relic would be unearthed in time. I can feel the power flowing through it!",
      "nm35aautha22160_.mp3": "Well done! You have impressed me greatly!",
      "nm35aautha22162_.mp3": "Yes, so I hear. I've had reports from some students that ventured into the tomb after you left and found the parts. Well done.",
      "nm35aautha22163_.mp3": "I am impressed. You have rid us of a potential nuisance.",
      "nm35aautha22164_.mp3": "Oh? I heard that the droid ran out and blasted off into the sky. We tracked it for a short while before it vanished from our scanners. What do you make of that?",
      "nm35aautha22166_.mp3": "[Success] I... suppose so. That would explain his disappearance from our scanners, certainly, though I would prefer proof. Still, it shows innovative thinking.",
      "nm35aautha22171_.mp3": "[Success] I... suppose that will have to do, though I would prefer proof of his destruction. Still, it shows innovative thinking.",
      "nm35aautha22172_.mp3": "[Failure] That is not good enough. Suppose his remains fall into the hands of the enemy, what then? And why did you not bring back proof?",
      "nm35aautha22173_.mp3": "Either way, you'll not gain any prestige for the act.",
      "nm35aautha22175_.mp3": "Ahh, my old master. Still... unless you bring back something of his, some writings or similar, I am unimpressed. Jorak's fate means nothing to me.",
      "nm35aautha22177_.mp3": "Oh? Let me see... it appears my old master was busy studying the writings in one of the tombs. How interesting. I do hope you had to pry this from his dead fingers.",
      "nm35aautha22178_.mp3": "Regardless, you have impressed me with your worthy act.",
      "nm35aautha22180_.mp3": "Oh? And why would that be of use to me? His interrogator already brought me that information moments ago.",
      "nm35aautha22181_.mp3": "A valiant attempt, young one, but you must be quicker than that if you wish to impress me.",
      "nm35aautha22182_.mp3": "You do? That is most interesting. Where might that be?",
      "nm35aautha22184_.mp3": "Hmm. How ironic that I recently had his vessel scrapped for parts, then. I had assumed it had been thoroughly scanned... apparently not.",
      "nm35aautha22185_.mp3": "Still... you have done well in bringing me information that others could not unearth on their own. I am impressed.",
      "nm35aautha22187_.mp3": "Oh? How very sad, young one. You should learn to grab your advantages whenever you can.",
      "nm35aautha22188_.mp3": "Regardless, I am no longer interested in the Mandalorian's weapon cache. We have moved on.",
      "nm35aautha22190_.mp3": "She did. Prestige is not shared, however, if that is what you are wondering. If you aided her, it was to her benefit and not yours.",
      "nm35aautha22192_.mp3": "*chuckle* I had heard that such an artifact existed. Tell me, young one... did you acquire this device by yourself?",
      "nm35aautha22194_.mp3": "You lie. Still, what matters is the fact that you succeeded. And Lashowe... does she yet live?",
      "nm35aautha22196_.mp3": "You didn't kill her? How very foolish. Now you have an enemy to contend with. The holocron, itself, is an impressive item, however.",
      "nm35aautha22198_.mp3": "Ha ha! Well done! You gained an artifact through trickery and eliminated an opponent at the same time. That is deserving of great prestige!",
      "nm35aautha22200_.mp3": "So I see. And Lashowe... does she yet live?",
      "nm35aautha22202_.mp3": "Killed her out of revenge, did you? Well done. I can appreciate such drama, believe me.",
      "nm35aautha22203_.mp3": "I am most impressed that you have eliminated an opponent so handily.",
      "nm35aautha22205_.mp3": "Yes, so I hear. Still, it was Shaardan's failure and hardly your success, now, was it? Not quite worthy of prestige.",
      "nm35aautha22207_.mp3": "Maybe it's better to say that Mekel is dead, yes? Considering the circumstances, I am unimpressed... though you do now have one less opponent.",
      "nm35aautha22209_.mp3": "Indeed. You have much to do, yet.",
      "nm35aautha22210_.mp3": "Very well. You have impressed me... definitely a good start.",
      "nm35aautha22211_.mp3": "You have gained considerable prestige... you are very close to the end. Do not falter now.",
      "nm35aautha22212_.mp3": "Greetings, young one. I have found you to be most impressive... you are off to an excellent beginning.",
      "nm35aautha22213_.mp3": "Greetings, young one. You have done very well for yourself so far. Continue and your promise shall be fulfilled.",
      "nm39aautha03000_.mp3": "Excellent work, my young Sith. Your enemy lies dead at your feet and you are victorious... the final test is complete.",
      "nm39aautha03001_.mp3": "I must say that... unnhh! What... what is happening?! My strength is... fading! What have you done?!",
      "nm39aautha03003_.mp3": "You... you fool! You will never... never be a Sith, now!!",
      "nm39aautha03005_.mp3": "You... I will destroy you, mongrel! I will rip the flesh from your bones!!",
      "nm39aautha03012_.mp3": "What?! But, but... why did... you come?! Why... are you here, if not to become Sith?!",
      "nm39aautha03014_.mp3": "I must say that it is quite disappointing that you must die now, as well, seeing as you didn't inform me earlier of Yuthura's plans.",
      "nm39aautha03016_.mp3": "So you did. And now I shall destroy you as I would any other Sith who betrayed me.",
      "nm39aautha03018_.mp3": "Destroy me? I am not Yuthura, young one. I am a Sith Master... and I tire of foolish upstarts.",
      "nm39aautha03020_.mp3": "Is that so? So you were a spy all along? How interesting.",
      "nm39aautha03021_.mp3": "So let's get this over with, shall we? I have a new batch of candidates arriving tomorrow.",
      "nm39aautha03024_.mp3": "I must say that it is quite disappointing that you must die now, as well, since there's no telling how far your scheming with Yuthura went.",
      "nm39aautha03025_.mp3": "You are truly a Sith in spirit, and one gifted with great power. Of this I no longer have any doubt. There is much more for you to learn, perhaps... but not here.",
      "nm39aautha03026_.mp3": "There is... something very strange about you, young one. Something I cannot place. You are like no other student I have ever met.",
      "nm39aautha03027_.mp3": "Why that is, I cannot say. Your path takes you elsewhere, however, and soon.",
      "nm39aautha03028_.mp3": "Go on to your destiny, then, and return here afterwards... if that is what you still desire.",
      "nm39aautha03030_.mp3": "You have passed the final test, but I see it is not yet your destiny to join the order. Perhaps that will come in time, young one.",
      "nm39aautha03031_.mp3": "There is much you must accomplish, first. The dark side has plans for you. As I said... return once that is done, if you desire.",
      "nm39aautha03033_.mp3": "May the Force serve you well, young one.",
      "nm39aautha03037_.mp3": "Is it... is it possible that you are not what you seem to be? Tell me, young one... tell me what you really are.",
      "nm39aautha03041_.mp3": "I see. No matter what you might be, then, I am certain that your path takes you elsewhere... and soon.",
      "nm39aautha03043_.mp3": "Ah, I see. So it is... Darth Revan, not dead as we were led to believe.",
      "nm39aautha03044_.mp3": "And yet... and yet you are *not* Revan, are you? What has occurred between the time of your reported death and now I can only guess at, but you have changed much.",
      "nm39aautha03045_.mp3": "Regardless, your destiny does take you away from here... to confront your old pupil, without a doubt. Yes... that is what lies before you.",
      "nm39aautha03046_.mp3": "Go to your destiny, then, my Dark Lord. I shall say nothing of what you have done here. Should you prove victorious and wish to return, then I and all Sith shall be your servants.",
      "nm39aautha03047_.mp3": "Do not let your attention waver! Strike her down!!",
      "nm39aautha03048_.mp3": "So you return to us with the lightsaber in hand, as I knew you would.",
      "nm39aautha03050_.mp3": "You took a great risk in acquiring the artifact. You used your mind and your power... no peaceful meditation, no pacifism.",
      "nm39aautha03051_.mp3": "Sometimes you must fight in order to achieve. This gives you your passion, this makes you stronger. This is what makes you superior.",
      "nm39aautha03052_.mp3": "That is the lesson we teach with that part of the final test. Do you understand?",
      "nm39aautha03054_.mp3": "True, but most would say they fight only when they must... or not at all. We are the ones who know that struggle is what makes us superior.",
      "nm39aautha03056_.mp3": "When a Jedi acts, it is with skill, true. But the Jedi teach you that your passions are counter-productive. That strength is only found in peace.",
      "nm39aautha03057_.mp3": "Did you not feel a moment of excitement in the tomb? Did your passions not flow and make you feel stronger and more alive?",
      "nm39aautha03058_.mp3": "What purpose would be served by restricting yourself from such? I would say only the purpose of the Jedi. Through this they would control you and restrict your potential.",
      "nm39aautha03060_.mp3": "Perhaps not, to someone of your natural strength. The point is in the recognition of the nature of the act rather than its sheer difficulty.",
      "nm39aautha03062_.mp3": "If you came to the academy, you must have felt the stirrings within you that cry out for the freedom of the dark side, that cry out for release.",
      "nm39aautha03063_.mp3": "I can only show you the path that will lead to power and superiority. You have followed it this far... you must decide if you are capable of continuing.",
      "nm39aautha03065_.mp3": "This is where your path ends, young one. There is no turning back once you have embarked on it.",
      "nm39aautha03067_.mp3": "Good. The last part of your test will now commence. Here you will learn the lesson of competition.",
      "nm39aautha03068_.mp3": "All life must compete in order to flourish. Such is the natural way of the universe. To stand still is to know death... one must always be moving forward.",
      "nm39aautha03069_.mp3": "So is it the same amongst the Sith. Compete or die. Mercy is irrelevant.",
      "nm39aautha03070_.mp3": "So it behooves you in this final test to strike down one you are familiar with, for no other reason than to prove you are superior and without mercy.",
      "nm39aautha03071_.mp3": "Normally this would be against another student. You, however, get a special treat. You will fight Yuthura, here... my own apprentice.",
      "nm39aautha03073_.mp3": "So... you know, do you? Well, it makes no difference. You have become too ambitious, Yuthura... it is time for you to die.",
      "nm39aautha03075_.mp3": "Oh? Is this true, young one? You wish to join Yuthura in her foolish scheme?",
      "nm39aautha03076_.mp3": "Sadly, Yuthura, it is you who are mistaken. Your pupil is more ambitious than you realize... isn't that so, young one?",
      "nm39aautha03079_.mp3": "So the time has come, has it? I... I will... ugh... no! My... strength leaves me!!",
      "nm39aautha03081_.mp3": "So the time has come, has it? You both wish to stand against a Sith Master and perish, do you? THEN SO BE IT!!",
      "nm39aautha03084_.mp3": "The final test continues as it should. Proceed and be rewarded, young one.",
      "nm39aautha03086_.mp3": "It appears, my dear, that some tests are fairer than others. I wish you luck.",
      "nm39aautha03090_.mp3": "You are indeed a fool if you think to oppose us both, young one.",
      "nm39aautha03093_.mp3": "This makes no sense. You will never become a Sith if you turn on us both! What could you hope to accomplish?",
      "nm39aautha03096_.mp3": "Do not fret, my dear. All will be... ugh... no! My strength... leaves me!!",
      "nm39aautha03099_.mp3": "You will never leave here!!",
      "nm39aautha03104_.mp3": "Do not fret, my dear. All will be as it was quickly enough.",
      "nm39aautha03115_.mp3": "Indeed. You have become too ambitious, Yuthura. It is time for you to die and someone more... talented... to take your place.",
      "nm39aautha03116_.mp3": "You must locate the ceremonial lightsaber and return here to us. Yuthura and I cannot help you in this, young one.",
      "nm39aautha03117_.mp3": "Very well. We are now ready for your final test, young Sith. You have earned the right to see if you shall become one of us.",
      "nm39aautha03119_.mp3": "I dislike your tone, Yuthura. What are you up to, now?",
      "nm39aautha03121_.mp3": "Yes. Yes, of course. We are in the sacred tomb of Naga Sadow, young one, the one discovered by Darth Malak and Darth Revan years ago.",
      "nm39aautha03122_.mp3": "You are to follow in their footsteps and reach the ancient Star Map that lies deep within. There you will find a lightsaber, amongst other things.",
      "nm39aautha03123_.mp3": "The lightsaber is for you: your initiation present. Return to us once you have it, for you the test does not end there.",
      "nm39aautha03125_.mp3": "Do you understand what I have told you? Are you ready to begin?",
      "nm39aautha03127_.mp3": "If you do not strive to achieve something, then it will be meaningless to you, wouldn't you say?",
      "nm39aautha03129_.mp3": "No. That is part of the test. Overcome the obstacles that lie ahead on your own.",
      "nm39aautha03131_.mp3": "You cannot. No one enters and no one leaves until your test is complete.",
      "nm39aautha03133_.mp3": "Good. Yuthura and I will await your return.",
      "nm39aautha03134_.mp3": "Is that a tone of mischief in your voice, dear Yuthura? You should know by now that no scheme is certain."

      "nm33aayuth21011_.mp3": "So one of the others accepted you, even after I did not? You are lucky, human, for I am in a forgiving mood.",
      "nm33aayuth21012_.mp3": "So I see. How curious that you should come to possess such a thing. Where did you get it?",
      "nm33aayuth21014_.mp3": "Can you not see that I am busy, human? Ahhh... I see you have a medallion. Where did you get it?",
      "nm33aayuth21016_.mp3": "I see. How very enterprising of you, though that is not the normal way that we select our students for the academy.",
      "nm33aayuth21018_.mp3": "[Success] Oh? By one of the others, no doubt. You do seem a fit candidate for the academy, though there is... something odd about you...",

      "nm33aayuth21021_.mp3": "[Failure] You think to lie to me, do you? I would suspect you stole this and killed the owner. Very enterprising of you, I must admit.",
      "nm33aayuth21022_.mp3": "We Sith do encourage such independent thinking. You may even be a suitable candidate to join us. That is what you wish, I take it? To become a Sith?",
      "nm33aayuth21024_.mp3": "Do not be insolent, human. I asked you a direct question, and I will not be trifled with. Now... where did you get this medallion?",
      "nm33aayuth21025_.mp3": "Is there something you need, Jedi? Make it good, for I have little patience.",
      "nm33aayuth21027_.mp3": "You think me a fool? You think I do not recognize a lightsaber when I see it?",
      "nm33aayuth21028_.mp3": "You think me a fool? You think I do not recognize robes of the order when I see them?",
      "nm33aayuth21029_.mp3": "You are far from the first Jedi who has come here, after all, willing to abandon that decrepit order of yours.",
      "nm33aayuth21030_.mp3": "Is there something you need, human? Make it good, for I have little patience.",
      "nm33aayuth21032_.mp3": "Who am I? You must not have been on Korriban for very long. Either that or you have been feeling your way about blindly.",
      "nm33aayuth21033_.mp3": "Luckily for you, I am in a charitable mood. I am Yuthura Ban, second only to Master Uthar of the Sith academy here in Dreshdae.",
      "nm33aayuth21034_.mp3": "I am the one who decides which few of the many hopefuls who travel here to train actually become a Sith. Why? Is it your desire to enter the academy? Is that why you are here?",
      "nm33aayuth21036_.mp3": "*chuckle* An interesting question, and not one I hear often. For most the benefits of becoming a Sith are quite obvious.",
      "nm33aayuth21037_.mp3": "We wield ultimate power, my friend. To be a Sith is to taste freedom and to know victory. Nothing is as glorious as bending the Force to your will.",
      "nm33aayuth21039_.mp3": "We make no apologies for the weak. If you cannot clench your fist and know when the moment comes to strike, there is no place for you amongst us.",
      "nm33aayuth21040_.mp3": "Of those who come to train, those who are weak return home. If they are both weak and foolish, they die... but it was their choice to come.",
      "nm33aayuth21042_.mp3": "You've heard enough, have you? *chuckle* So what is it to be? Are you here to be a Sith or not?",
      "nm33aayuth21046_.mp3": "Oh? That is truly a first. Do as you wish, then, human. I'll not stop you.",
      "nm33aayuth21048_.mp3": "Hide-bound relics who burden themselves with tradition and with the protection of the weak and ungrateful. They are pitiful and misguided.",
      "nm33aayuth21049_.mp3": "Why would you take a gift as glorious as the Force and squander it? Weaken yourself deliberately and shackle yourself to outdated mores?",
      "nm33aayuth21050_.mp3": "Our gift has made us superior. It is our rightful place to rule. How can any deny that? Yet the Jedi do so... and call us 'evil' because we do not.",
      "nm33aayuth21052_.mp3": "Is the sarkath beast who dominates his jungle evil? The tuk'ata who leaps on the squellbug for the kill? These are things of nature, of the universe.",
      "nm33aayuth21053_.mp3": "We are no different from this. The Force is part of the universe, part of the same laws. We were gifted to set us above the rest... to deny nature is foolish.",
      "nm33aayuth21055_.mp3": "It is the Jedi who serve the Force... trying to discern its wishes like frightened old men staring at the stars. The Force serves *us*.",
      "nm33aayuth21056_.mp3": "We shape it to our will. We are its master. The Jedi deny their darkness, but we revel in it, we allow it to fuel our strength.",
      "nm33aayuth21059_.mp3": "It is true that the Force exacts a physical toll on some... but not a single one of them has ever regretted it. Anything else you hear is propaganda.",
      "nm33aayuth21061_.mp3": "You know the name? Malak is the strongest of us, and the strongest always rules... at least until one who is stronger can take it from him.",
      "nm33aayuth21062_.mp3": "That is our way: survival of the fittest. You are always on guard, always lean for the kill. We promote it, for through this the Sith are stronger.",
      "nm33aayuth21064_.mp3": "If a Sith has proven to be weak... and if the time is right. The Force rewards the cunning and the mighty. Step up to the challenge if you dare... or turn tail and run.",
      "nm33aayuth21066_.mp3": "I would consider that an amusing ploy to try and enter the Academy. Why? Who will you claim to be? Darth Malak, himself?",
      "nm33aayuth21068_.mp3": "What about Revan? Revan is dead. You may have a natural gift with the Force, human, but you've no gift for lies.",
      "nm33aayuth21070_.mp3": "And yet here you are on little Korriban, just by accident? I find it hard to believe. If it amuses you, however, I'll play along.",
      "nm33aayuth21072_.mp3": "No? Why might that be? There is something... odd about you, human, that I cannot place...",
      "nm33aayuth21074_.mp3": "Ahhh, so you are just another hopeful after all. Or are you? There is something odd about you that I cannot place...",
      "nm33aayuth21075_.mp3": "Obviously you are a Jedi. One who is very strong in the Force, it seems. So were you part of the order for very long? Did they train you?",
      "nm33aayuth21076_.mp3": "I sense... that you are very strong in the Force. That you have already honed some of your abilities. Jedi training, is it?",
      "nm33aayuth21078_.mp3": "*chuckle* As you wish. Play your little game, Jedi, if you must. Either way, I sense an intriguing amount of power within you.",
      "nm33aayuth21079_.mp3": "*chuckle* As you wish. Keep your little secrets, human, if you must. Either way, I sense an intriguing amount of power within you.",
      "nm33aayuth21081_.mp3": "As I thought. How interesting that they would let one with such power out of their grasp. Or are you here to spy on us? For all the good it would do.",
      "nm33aayuth21083_.mp3": "A Padawan, perhaps, though it makes little difference. I sense enough raw power within you to... well, we shall see.",
      "nm33aayuth21085_.mp3": "Perhaps none. Perhaps all the difference in the world. Either way, you possess enough raw power to intrigue me greatly.",
      "nm33aayuth21086_.mp3": "With that kind of power, you could become a great Sith. Perhaps... if I let you. Does that interest you?",
      "nm33aayuth21088_.mp3": "Ah, good. Exactly the sort of answer I was hoping for.",
      "nm33aayuth21091_.mp3": "Hmm. A strange response, indeed. Is your mind maladjusted in some way? You should make for an interesting pupil, indeed.",
      "nm33aayuth21092_.mp3": "With that kind of power, you could become a great Sith. Perhaps... if I let you. Does that interest you?",
      "nm33aayuth21094_.mp3": "A pity. And here you were already given the medallion and everything.",
      "nm33aayuth21095_.mp3": "A pity. Here I hadn't even decided, yet.",
      "nm33aayuth21096_.mp3": "Well, human... should you change your mind, you know where to come.",
      "nm33aayuth21098_.mp3": "[Failure] *chuckle* You must not think much of Sith masters to try that little trick. I won't hold it against you, however... it shows initiative.",
      "nm33aayuth21099_.mp3": "But I do desire a real answer to my question... does it interest you?",
      "nm33aayuth21101_.mp3": "[Success] Ah, good. Exactly the sort of answer I was hoping for.",
      "nm33aayuth21103_.mp3": "[Success] Ah, good. Exactly the sort of answer I was hoping for.",
      "nm33aayuth21104_.mp3": "I will take you to the academy and we shall see if you are ready to join the ranks of the Sith.",
      "nm33aayuth21105_.mp3": "I have only one other question. These... companions of yours? They will not be coming with you, I presume?",
      "nm33aayuth21108_.mp3": "There is... something odd about this servant of yours...",
      "nm33aayuth21109_.mp3": "No matter. Make sure they don't disturb your training or cause trouble. You are responsible for them. Now... are you ready to go to the academy?",
      "nm33aayuth21112_.mp3": "I see. Fair enough, so long as they do not disturb your training or cause any trouble. Are you ready to go to the academy, then?",
      "nm33aayuth21113_.mp3": "Are you ready to go there now?",
      "nm33aayuth21114_.mp3": "[Failure] I see. Somehow, however, I am unconvinced.",
      "nm33aayuth21115_.mp3": "No, my friend... I'll not be the one to bring you into our academy. If one of the other Sith accept you and give you a medallion, then perhaps.",
      "nm33aayuth21116_.mp3": "But otherwise... not today. Run along now.",
      "nm33aayuth21118_.mp3": "[Success] Ah, good. Exactly the sort of answer I was hoping for.",
      "nm33aayuth21120_.mp3": "What an odd thing to say... and, even stranger, I do not sense any deception within you. You are a curious puzzle, human, a puzzle with great power.",
      "nm33aayuth21122_.mp3": "I am. Obviously you have been told of me. Is it your desire, then, to train at the academy? Do you wish to become a Sith, human?",
      "nm33aayuth21124_.mp3": "I am sure there are plenty of others here who would answer your questions. I am quite busy. So if there is nothing else...?",
      "nm33aayuth21126_.mp3": "As you wish.",
      "nm35aautha22007_.mp3": "A human that has had some training, it seems, Master Uthar. Very promising, I think.",
      "nm35aautha22028_.mp3": "I dare, Master Uthar! I am ready!",
      "nm35aautha22042_.mp3": "As Master Uthar said, none of you are true Sith *yet*. For that to occur, one of you must do enough of worth... gain enough prestige... to be selected.",
      "nm35aautha22043_.mp3": "What is an act of worth? You must learn that for yourselves. Remember that you are competitors, here... fight for your destiny, or go home.",
      "nm35aayuth24000_.mp3": "Your destiny does not lie with the Sith... at least, not yet. The academy is mine, now... I trust you won't be remaining long, correct?",
      "nm35aayuth24001_.mp3": "Ah, there you are... my favorite prospect for the year.",
      "nm35aayuth24003_.mp3": "Absolutely. By my estimation, you are far more likely to achieve the prestige necessary to join the Sith than any of the others.",
      "nm35aayuth24004_.mp3": "As a matter of fact, I am so certain of that that I'm willing to offer you an opportunity of the once-in-a-lifetime variety. Would you like to hear it?",
      "nm35aayuth24006_.mp3": "Good. I do so adore someone who's willing to take a chance.",
      "nm35aayuth24007_.mp3": "As I said, you're no doubt going to be the one whom Uthar chooses to become a Sith. With my help, of course.",
      "nm35aayuth24008_.mp3": "Once that occurs, he will take you into the Valley of the Dark Lords to the tomb of Naga Sadow to administer the final test.",
      "nm35aayuth24009_.mp3": "There you and I will be alone with him. The perfect time to, shall we say, arrange for a change in the academy's leadership?",
      "nm35aayuth24011_.mp3": "The tomb is an ancient ruin on the surface that was visited years ago by Darth Revan and Darth Malak. They discovered a Star Map there of great importance.",
      "nm35aayuth24016_.mp3": "Reaching that map, as they did, is part of the final test. At any rate, it is not the tomb that is important. That Uthar will be alone is what is important.",
      "nm35aayuth24018_.mp3": "Is that such a daunting prospect? It is not as if I am asking you to perform the task alone, or as if you will get nothing out of it.",
      "nm35aayuth24019_.mp3": "Master Uthar cannot prevail against us both. That's all there is to it. It is a very simple matter.",
      "nm35aayuth24021_.mp3": "And so it should. It is central to our beliefs. It is my responsibility to replace my master when I am strong enough.",
      "nm35aayuth24023_.mp3": "I'm so glad you see it my way.",
      "nm35aayuth24024_.mp3": "I will begin to make preparations for your final test. Your only worry now is to get there... don't disappoint me.",
      "nm35aayuth24026_.mp3": "You are already a part of this. Don't be a fool.",
      "nm35aayuth24028_.mp3": "I suppose you could do that. Even the hint of betrayal from his pupil and Uthar would move to eliminate me.",
      "nm35aayuth24029_.mp3": "But this is a very good opportunity for you... you can start off your Sith career as the right hand of the head of the academy: me. Uthar will not offer you that.",
      "nm35aayuth24030_.mp3": "Do you believe Uthar would not be aware of this? He would quickly figure out what you have to gain by betraying him... and would never believe someone would pass that up.",
      "nm35aayuth24031_.mp3": "Tell Master Uthar what you wish. Were I you, I would think first of what the consequences of such an action might be.",
      "nm35aayuth24033_.mp3": "My 'part' in this is to help you gain enough prestige... and slow down the progress of the other hopefuls. I want you in that tomb when the time is right.",
      "nm35aayuth24034_.mp3": "We destroy Master Uthar together and I take his place... and you take your place at my side. A beautiful plan in its sheer simplicity.",
      "nm35aayuth24036_.mp3": "*chuckle* You must not know much about the Sith, yet. If Uthar were to even suspect that I might be trying to supplant him, true or not...",
      "nm35aayuth24037_.mp3": "Well, let's just say that he wouldn't likely stop to ask too many questions before ensuring I was dealt with.",
      "nm35aayuth24039_.mp3": "Not really. Oh, don't worry... what I have in mind will benefit us both, you can be sure of that.",
      "nm35aayuth24041_.mp3": "'Yet' being the operative term. As I said, you have my utmost confidence.",
      "nm35aayuth24042_.mp3": "What are you doing here? Go back to Uthar and tell him you're ready to take your final test! Our moment is at hand, go!",
      "nm35aayuth24043_.mp3": "Hmmm. You're a rather tricky human, aren't you? However did you manage to convince Kel Algwinn to reveal himself to you?",
      "nm35aayuth24044_.mp3": "No matter. I applaud you for the maneuver, at any rate. An act worthy of a Sith, surely.",
      "nm35aayuth24046_.mp3": "Now that's what I like to see... the flash of ambition in a young human's eyes. Your species has such remarkable retinal coloring, did you know that?",
      "nm35aayuth24048_.mp3": "Yes, I... suppose so. The weak can surprise you sometimes with their strength, however. He could have surprised us.",
      "nm35aayuth24050_.mp3": "What's this? Regrets? Not to worry, dear pupil, it... gets easier with time.",
      "nm35aayuth24051_.mp3": "You have other things to turn your attention to, however, I'm sure. What do you need?",
      "nm35aayuth24052_.mp3": "I understand you managed to kill Lashowe. Well done! She was devious, but I knew her trust could be turned against her!",
      "nm35aayuth24053_.mp3": "So... you managed to kill Shaardan, did you? Good news travels quickly. Well done... he wouldn't have made a good Sith, anyway.",
      "nm35aayuth24054_.mp3": "You killed Mekel, I hear? Well... I suppose it is just as well. He was far too devious to be allowed to live.",
      "nm35aayuth24055_.mp3": "One less opponent is an excellent result regardless of how it occurs, correct? Now, then... something you needed?",
      "nm35aayuth24056_.mp3": "You've been doing well... I hear you've almost enough prestige to be declared the victor. Somehow I just knew you were the one who would succeed.",
      "nm35aayuth24057_.mp3": "I hear that you have gained even more prestige. You are closing in on victory... this is good.",
      "nm35aayuth24058_.mp3": "I understand you have impressed Master Uthar at least a little. That is good... we are one step closer towards completing my plan.",
      "nm35aayuth24059_.mp3": "Were I you, I would not get too excited just yet. You still have plenty left to do.",
      "nm35aayuth24060_.mp3": "Greetings, my friend. *chuckle* I do rather enjoy saying that.",
      "nm35aayuth24061_.mp3": "Hello, again. I trust all is going smoothly?",
      "nm35aayuth24062_.mp3": "What do you wish? I am eager to get this over with.",
      "nm35aayuth24064_.mp3": "What? What's happened? Our plan is still intact, I hope.",
      "nm35aayuth24066_.mp3": "Ahhh. How very clever of him. Normally you would face some other student in the tomb, preferably one of the failed ones.",
      "nm35aayuth24067_.mp3": "Obviously Uthar has decided to get rid of me. But why...? Did you say something to him?",
      "nm35aayuth24069_.mp3": "What?! You fool! While I respect your attempt to play both sides of the fence, you are playing a dangerous game.",
      "nm35aayuth24070_.mp3": "If you think Uthar will truly be so grateful to you for double-crossing me, think again. Your only chance lies with me.",
      "nm35aayuth24072_.mp3": "[Success] Then how could he suspect? Unless one of the others... never mind. It is not important, now.",
      "nm35aayuth24073_.mp3": "In the end, it works out better that it is only the two of us in the tomb with him. So long as we refuse to fight. Is there anything else I should know?",
      "nm35aayuth24075_.mp3": "Let me see that. Hmm... so it's true. Thank you for bringing this to me... now I will be far stronger than Uthar expects.",
      "nm35aayuth24077_.mp3": "Hah! He's a fool. I can make preparations to resist any poisons. Thank you for telling me... now I will be far stronger than Uthar expects.",
      "nm35aayuth24080_.mp3": "Good. I'm not about to rest on my laurels, however.",
      "nm35aayuth24081_.mp3": "Here... this passcard will allow you access to Uthar's quarters. It's at the far end of the passages with the other quarters.",
      "nm35aayuth24082_.mp3": "Take this device as well and put it inside his cot. No-one should see you do it. Then Uthar will be too weak to stand up against us.",
      "nm35aayuth24083_.mp3": "Don't even think of failing me. You and I are too far into this now to back out.",
      "nm35aayuth24084_.mp3": "[Failure] Hmph. I truly doubt that. You are attempting to play both sides of the fence, I think. I respect that. You are playing a dangerous game, however.",
      "nm35aayuth24086_.mp3": "Good. Let's keep it that way.",
      "nm35aayuth24088_.mp3": "You must impress Master Uthar... go to him with news of your deeds or artifacts you have discovered.",
      "nm35aayuth24089_.mp3": "The first and easiest way would be for you to learn the Code of the Sith and speak it to him. I can teach you that, if you like.",
      "nm35aayuth24090_.mp3": "Shall I go on?",
      "nm35aayuth24093_.mp3": "Fair enough.",
      "nm35aayuth24094_.mp3": "The Code of the Sith is the easiest way, to start. I have told you all that you need to know of it, already.",
      "nm35aayuth24095_.mp3": "There are a group of students who refused an order by Master Uthar to execute a group of civilians in the colony.",
      "nm35aayuth24096_.mp3": "Uthar declared that they were to be executed, themselves, but the students escaped and fled before the order could be carried out.",
      "nm35aayuth24097_.mp3": "We are certain that they have not left Korriban. No doubt they have not gotten far and are simply in hiding... we just do not know where, exactly.",
      "nm35aayuth24098_.mp3": "If you were to locate them and carry out Uthar's order, I am sure he would be most appreciative.",
      "nm35aayuth24099_.mp3": "Shall I go on?",
      "nm35aayuth24101_.mp3": "The rebel students I told you about must still be found and dealt with... Master Uthar would be greatly impressed by their deaths, I am sure.",
      "nm35aayuth24102_.mp3": "I would suggest you talk to the other prospective Sith and find one that you can gain an advantage with.",
      "nm35aayuth24103_.mp3": "I believe Lashowe would be an excellent choice. She is too trusting. I have little doubt you could talk her into letting you 'help' her somehow.",
      "nm35aayuth24104_.mp3": "Just make sure that it is you who gains the advantage, not her. Be ruthless, if you must. That is the only thing that will impress Uthar.",
      "nm35aayuth24105_.mp3": "I still think that approaching Lashowe would be your best move. She is too trusting and can no doubt be talked into aiding your cause.",
      "nm35aayuth24106_.mp3": "The only other idea I can suggest to you is that you head into the Valley of the Dark Lords on the surface. There are ancient ruins there which can be explored.",
      "nm35aayuth24107_.mp3": "It's possible you might find some artifacts or information in them which would please Uthar... it's difficult to say for certain.",
      "nm35aayuth24109_.mp3": "I can help you to understand it. Would you like to hear it?",
      "nm35aayuth24110_.mp3": "\"Peace is a lie, there is only passion.\nThrough passion, I gain strength.\nThrough strength, I gain power.",
      "nm35aayuth24111_.mp3": "Through power, I gain victory.\nThrough victory, my chains are broken.\nThe Force shall free me.\"",
      "nm35aayuth24112_.mp3": "Simple words, yet easily misunderstood. Would you care for me to explain anything?",
      "nm35aayuth24114_.mp3": "The Jedi would have you believe that peace is a desirable goal. That peace of the spirit is the way the Force is mastered, that a lack of conflict betters man.",
      "nm35aayuth24115_.mp3": "We know different. It is our passion... our hate and our desire... that fuels the Force. It is conflict that improves the lot of civilization and single being both.",
      "nm35aayuth24116_.mp3": "Conflict forces one to better oneself. It forces change, growth, adaption... evolution... or death. These are not our laws, but the universe's. Without conflict you have only stagnation.",
      "nm35aayuth24118_.mp3": "What fuels your power with the Force but your passion? The stronger, darker emotions. Anger, hatred, fear... these passions empower us.",
      "nm35aayuth24120_.mp3": "Love is more dangerous than all those things. Love leads to anger and hatred more often that not... but it also leads to mercy, which is far worse. That, however, is a lesson for another time.",
      "nm35aayuth24122_.mp3": "Negative? Compared to what? What keeps even the most rudimentary creature alive? Fear to run, anger to fight... without it a creature would most surely die.",
      "nm35aayuth24124_.mp3": "We are far more than them, perhaps, but in some ways we are little different. To think us creatures beyond the need of simple passions is a delusion.",
      "nm35aayuth24126_.mp3": "The Force gives us all power, even the Jedi. It is our mastery of our passion that gives us the strength they lack.",
      "nm35aayuth24128_.mp3": "It is our goal to be stronger, to achieve our potential and not rest upon our laurels. We are the seekers, not the shepherds.",
      "nm35aayuth24130_.mp3": "The stronger you become in the Force, the more power you will achieve. But always must you fight for your power.",
      "nm35aayuth24131_.mp3": "Without strife, your victory has no meaning. Without strife, you do not advance. Without strife, there is only stagnation.",
      "nm35aayuth24133_.mp3": "How many sorts of victories can you imagine? Peaceful victory? Victory by sacrifice? A truce, an achievement?",
      "nm35aayuth24134_.mp3": "Unless the victory is achieved by demonstrating that your power is superior, it is only an illusion. Temporary at best. We seek more.",
      "nm35aayuth24136_.mp3": "This... has been argued over, and often. The chains represent our restrictions, both those placed upon us and those we place upon ourselves.",
      "nm35aayuth24137_.mp3": "Ultimately the goal of any Sith is to free herself from such restrictions. In a way, it is so we may do whatever we wish... but it is much more than that.",
      "nm35aayuth24138_.mp3": "One who has freed themselves from all restrictions has reached perfection. Their potential fulfilled. Perfect strength, perfect power, perfect destiny. Imagine it.",
      "nm35aayuth24139_.mp3": "That is our ideal, at any rate. It is said in Sith legend that the 'Sith'ari'... the perfect being... will one day lead us. But perhaps that is just a legend.",
      "nm35aayuth24141_.mp3": "I... wonder what a being would be like. The legends say the Sith'ari will destroy us... and make us stronger than ever.",
      "nm35aayuth24142_.mp3": "But perhaps that is just a legend. Perfection is... a goal, I think, rather than a state of being. The Jedi would argue that, no doubt.",
      "nm35aayuth24144_.mp3": "The Force is our servant and our master. Our teacher and our companion. A weapon and a tool.",
      "nm35aayuth24145_.mp3": "Know it and you know the universe. Master it and you master the universe. Strive for perfection and the Force shall reward you.",
      "nm35aayuth24147_.mp3": "I am not surprised. The Force is strong with you... master it and it shall serve you well.",
      "nm35aayuth24150_.mp3": "I have been involved in the work there over the last couple of years, but not often. Most of the excavating is left to the students. What did you wish to know?",
      "nm35aayuth24152_.mp3": "Not unless you are accompanied by Master Uthar, no. It is strictly forbidden... and I truly doubt you could bypass the doors to the tomb with anything less than ship blasters. Even then, perhaps.",
      "nm35aayuth24154_.mp3": "None. I do not even know how Master Uthar gains entrance, to tell the truth, though I look forward to discovering that fact.",
      "nm35aayuth24155_.mp3": "I have searched many times, so do not bother... there is no other way. Do not fret, however. Simply get the prestige you need and you will see the tomb soon enough.",
      "nm35aayuth24157_.mp3": "Perhaps we could learn more about the origin of the Force, itself. With that knowledge could come great power.",
      "nm35aayuth24159_.mp3": "As you wish.",
      "nm35aayuth24161_.mp3": "Revan? You mean Darth Malak's former master?",
      "nm35aayuth24163_.mp3": "Very little. I never met him personally, though I hear he was a powerful man. Very charismatic.",
      "nm35aayuth24164_.mp3": "In the end, Revan was outshone by his pupil. Such is the way of the Sith. Why? Is this dead man of importance to you?",
      "nm35aayuth24165_.mp3": "Very little. I never met her personally, though I hear she was a powerful woman. Very charismatic.",
      "nm35aayuth24166_.mp3": "In the end, Revan was outshone by her pupil. Such is the way of the Sith. Why? Is this dead woman of importance to you?",
      "nm35aayuth24168_.mp3": "Anything is possible. Uthar's former master still lives... though he is in no condition to challenge his former pupil for leadership.",
      "nm35aayuth24169_.mp3": "Perhaps the same is true for Revan. Perhaps Revan is out there, somewhere, waiting to take revenge upon Malak.",
      "nm35aayuth24170_.mp3": "More likely what we were told is the truth: Revan is dead. Malak would be foolish to leave his old master alive, considering all the knowledge Revan held.",
      "nm35aayuth24172_.mp3": "Is there any reason I should? Beside the fact that I did not know Revan in life, Revan was known for wearing a full helmet and cape.",
      "nm35aayuth24173_.mp3": "Perhaps Revan's body had been disfigured by the power of the Force... it is not unheard of. Regardless, I doubt I shall be meeting Revan anytime soon.",
      "nm35aayuth24175_.mp3": "Both Revan and Malak came to Korriban when they discovered the tomb of Naga Sadow. That was before my time.",
      "nm35aayuth24178_.mp3": "Yes... vaguely. The boy burdens himself with doubts and anxieties. It is sad to watch, really, for he does possess a certain flair with the Force.",
      "nm35aayuth24179_.mp3": "Kel will not survive long. Someone will betray him soon enough, and he will be dead. If you are smart and you know something, that person should be you.",
      "nm35aayuth24181_.mp3": "About myself? I am originally from Sleheyron, if you must know. I was a slave to a cruel master, Omeesh the Hutt. I am sure you don't need to know more.",
      "nm35aayuth24183_.mp3": "I did. I also said that you didn't need to know more. Why are you asking?",
      "nm35aayuth24185_.mp3": "[Success] I... see. Very well. I suppose there's no harm in the tale.",
      "nm35aayuth24186_.mp3": "As I said, I was originally a slave to one of the Hutts. The Hutts control everything on Sleheyron, and a slave is nothing to them.",
      "nm35aayuth24187_.mp3": "I was determined not to be 'nothing'. One night when the drunken worm had me alone in his chambers I stabbed him and escaped the compound.",
      "nm35aayuth24188_.mp3": "I stole onto a cargo ship and was not discovered by the crew until they reached the next system. They left me for dead on a desolate planetoid, alone... but that was fine by me. I was glad to be anywhere other than Sleheyron.",
      "nm35aayuth24189_.mp3": "It was not luck that I was eventually rescued, of course. The Force was strong with me, though I didn't know that at the time. Not until the Jedi told me, that is.",
      "nm35aayuth24191_.mp3": "I'd... rather not discuss it. Perhaps another time.",
      "nm35aayuth24192_.mp3": "[Failure] You know all that you need to. We can exchange niceties once Uthar is gone, if you desire.",
      "nm35aayuth24194_.mp3": "Is there something else you needed?",
      "nm35aayuth24196_.mp3": "I... would prefer not to discuss that.",
      "nm35aayuth24198_.mp3": "Why? There is no point. Have I asked you about your past?",
      "nm35aayuth24200_.mp3": "[Success] You... have odd notions for someone hoping to become a Sith.",
      "nm35aayuth24201_.mp3": "Let's see... after escaping from Sleheyron I was found by the Jedi. They took me in and trained me even though I was a bit older than most Padawans.",
      "nm35aayuth24203_.mp3": "Not really, no. I never progressed beyond Padawan. I had discipline, but no peace... and after my treatment at the hands of the Hutts there was little room in me for the ways of the Jedi.",
      "nm35aayuth24205_.mp3": "Yes, well... I imagine I am not unique. Things very easily could have been very different for me.",
      "nm35aayuth24207_.mp3": "I wanted to use the Force to free the other slaves I knew, to fight for what I knew was right. The Jedi restrained me until I couldn't stand it any more.",
      "nm35aayuth24208_.mp3": "They claim the dark side is evil, but that isn't so. Sometimes anger and hatred are deserved and right. Sometimes things change because of it.",
      "nm35aayuth24210_.mp3": "Any failure to get the results I want is due to a lack of power on my part. That can change, in time. As a Sith, my mettle is tested far more than when I was a Padawan.",
      "nm35aayuth24212_.mp3": "No... not yet. But my anger has not diminished, nor my desire to see change. The more time I spend with the Sith the more I am certain that one day I will be able to fight as I must.",
      "nm35aayuth24214_.mp3": "There is suffering and injustice in the universe. I am surprised the Jedi can even stand the stench of it, much less stand by and do nothing.",
      "nm35aayuth24215_.mp3": "I know this may sound strange, but only my compassion stands in my way, now. Once that is gone let the slavers beware.",
      "nm35aayuth24217_.mp3": "I... yes, of course. I mean losing my compassion as in... holding back...",
      "nm35aayuth24219_.mp3": "I... well, there is much training to do. I... may be a long time...",
      "nm35aayuth24221_.mp3": "Thank you. I only wish I was as strong with the Force as you are. You could change much, yourself, if you wanted to.",
      "nm35aayuth24223_.mp3": "I suppose I shouldn't be telling you these things... sharing my weaknesses with you. Being a Sith doesn't make me a monster, however.",
      "nm35aayuth24224_.mp3": "But enough of that. I've talked about myself too much, surely you are tired of it.",
      "nm35aayuth24225_.mp3": "[Failure] Friends? We can be friends once Uthar is dead. Until then, a 'friend' is a weakness.",
      "nm35aayuth24227_.mp3": "[Success] I see. You... certainly have odd notions for one hoping to become a Sith. I'll play along... for now.",
      "nm35aayuth24229_.mp3": "[Failure] There is always harm in becoming too vulnerable. I will not be as weak as you desire.",
      "nm35aayuth24231_.mp3": "I hope to see you again.",
      "nm35aayuth24232_.mp3": "Come back soon... my friend.",
      "nm35aayuth24233_.mp3": "You are very close to succeeding... work quickly!",
      "nm35aayuth24234_.mp3": "You have had an excellent start... go, gain more prestige!",
      "nm35aayuth24235_.mp3": "You have much to do.",
      "nm35aayuth24333_.mp3": "We could learn much about the history of the ancient Sith... why they were on Korriban and why they left.",
      "nm36aaends08000_.mp3": "You there! How is it that you are leaving Naga Sadow's tomb by yourself? You went for your final test, didn't you? Where is Master Uthar?",
      "nm36aaends08002_.mp3": "What? You... but you aren't even a Sith, yet! Surely you jest!",
      "nm36aaends08004_.mp3": "You lie!",
      "nm36aaends08006_.mp3": "Don't be a sniveling coward! I will prove this one a spy... and if Uthar is dead, *I* shall become the new master!!",
      "nm36aaends08008_.mp3": "It... it's a spy! Quick, to arms!",
      "nm36aaends08010_.mp3": "Don't be such a coward! Kill the traitor! Do it now!!",
      "nm36aaends08014_.mp3": "[Failure] You lie! You could never have killed the master!!",
      "nm36aaends08016_.mp3": "You are not Revan! Quick, attack the traitor!!",
      "nm36aaends08018_.mp3": "If Master Uthar is dead, then he was a weak fool! Now attack! *I* shall be the new Dark Lord of Korriban!!",
      "nm36aaends08022_.mp3": "[Failure] You lie!",
      "nm36aaends08024_.mp3": "Well, you've found it! If you've done anything to Master Uthar, you're going to pay for it!",
      "nm36aalash02000_.mp3": "Wonderful! Ha ha! The beast is dead! We work better together than I would have hoped.",
      "nm36aalash02002_.mp3": "And here is the holocron. Such a small thing to be so valuable and require so much effort to obtain.",
      "nm36aalash02004_.mp3": "I'll just run along, now, and give this to Master Uthar. I'll be sure to tell him of your contribution, naturally.",
      "nm36aalash02006_.mp3": "You're the one that convinced me to go through with this plan. Why wouldn't I see it through?",
      "nm36aalash02008_.mp3": "Forget it. There is no guarantee. You helped me, I'll help you. Or don't you trust me?",
      "nm36aalash02012_.mp3": "Forget it. I'm not waiting up for you. That wasn't our plan, anyway.",
      "nm36aalash02015_.mp3": "Back off, I'm warning you! I'm not giving this up!",
      "nm36aalash02018_.mp3": "You're not getting the holocron. This was my idea! The plan was that I take it back, not you!",
      "nm36aalash02021_.mp3": "Over my dead body!!",
      "nm36aalash02025_.mp3": "Good. You have my... appreciation... for all your help. Good luck in your efforts.",
      "nm36aalash02027_.mp3": "There you are. Finally. If you were any later in showing up, we would have had to abandon this.",
      "nm36aalash02029_.mp3": "I've been calling to the tuk'ata mother in their language. She should respond fairly -- ahhh, here she comes now.",
      "nm36aalash02031_.mp3": "Get ready. This will not be easy... she's a tough beast.",
      "nm39aautha03049_.mp3": "The Force has served you well.",
      "nm39aautha03072_.mp3": "You talk too much, old fool.",
      "nm39aautha03074_.mp3": "No, it is time for *you* to die, master. My pupil stands with me.",
      "nm39aautha03078_.mp3": "Do you hear that, my master? That is the sound of a new leader rising to replace you.",
      "nm39aautha03080_.mp3": "You are weak, Uthar, and the Force has abandoned you. We have made sure of it!",
      "nm39aautha03083_.mp3": "You fool! You have no idea what you've done!",
      "nm39aautha03085_.mp3": "The only 'reward'... you... no! My strength... is leaving me!!",
      "nm39aautha03087_.mp3": "You... betrayed me?! I thought... we were friends! Damn you!!",
      "nm39aautha03088_.mp3": "The only 'reward' you will get is death!!",
      "nm39aautha03091_.mp3": "To think I actually believed for a moment that you and I were friends. So be it.",
      "nm39aautha03092_.mp3": "Hmph. To think that I actually hoped you could be of use to me.",
      "nm39aautha03095_.mp3": "Betrayed! He *is* a spy!",
      "nm39aautha03097_.mp3": "The poison! You will pay for this, you... you... damn you! My blood burns!!",
      "nm39aautha03103_.mp3": "The poison! You will pay for this! We will destroy you!!",
      "nm39aautha03105_.mp3": "You will pay for this, you... you... Damn you! My strength... it's... poisoned!",
      "nm39aautha03106_.mp3": "You will pay for this, fool! We will destroy you!!",
      "nm39aautha03107_.mp3": "Betrayed! She *is* a spy!",
      "nm39aautha03114_.mp3": "What?! So this is what you had planned all along. You wish me killed.",
      "nm39aautha03118_.mp3": "Indeed you have.",
      "nm39aautha03120_.mp3": "Nothing of course, my master. I was merely agreeing with you. Should we not get on with the test?",
      "nm39aautha03124_.mp3": "Be very cautious, here. This tomb is like the others in this valley, and many of its old defenses remain active.",
      "nm39aautha03135_.mp3": "As should you, my master. But I was only agreeing with you. Should we not get on with the test?",
      "nm39aautha03136_.mp3": "I... I don't know what you're talking about, master. I am not... scheming. Should we not get on with the test?",
      "nm39aayuth04000_.mp3": "Unghhh! Stop! I... I yield!",
      "nm39aayuth04001_.mp3": "You are... too strong for me. I was a fool to think otherwise. I am... at your mercy.",
      "nm39aayuth04003_.mp3": "Then it ends here.",
      "nm39aayuth04005_.mp3": "I... suppose I am. Something tells me that you are... not like the other students. I don't know why that is.",
      "nm39aayuth04006_.mp3": "I... was right the first time, back at the cantina, wasn't I? There is something different about you... more so than I even suspected.",
      "nm39aayuth04008_.mp3": "No, I don't suppose you can.",
      "nm39aayuth04009_.mp3": "So what happens now? Will you show me mercy? Will you... just let me leave?",
      "nm39aayuth04011_.mp3": "I... understand. May the Force serve you well.",
      "nm39aayuth04013_.mp3": "I had no choice. You... reminded me too much of a time before I became a Sith. I... didn't want to think about that.",
      "nm39aayuth04015_.mp3": "[Success] I... suppose you could be right.",
      "nm39aayuth04016_.mp3": "All the things I wanted to do, all the wrongs I wanted to right... I haven't done any of it. They just get farther and farther from my mind.",
      "nm39aayuth04017_.mp3": "All I've cared about is power and... and myself. This isn't the person I was.",
      "nm39aayuth04019_.mp3": "You're right. Maybe... maybe what I needed most was peace, after all. The Jedi tried to show me that.",
      "nm39aayuth04020_.mp3": "I don't know if I can ever go back to them... but my place isn't here. Thank you... thank you for showing me that.",
      "nm39aayuth04021_.mp3": "You have a destiny, my friend, and I wish you well on your way to it. May the Force... be with you.",
      "nm39aayuth04022_.mp3": "You are too powerful. You would never be my second for long... if the academy even truly interested you.",
      "nm39aayuth04024_.mp3": "I... I see. Then let us end this here.",
      "nm39aayuth04027_.mp3": "Very well. I... won't stop you, or mention what you've done here.",
      "nm39aayuth04028_.mp3": "You have a destiny to fulfill, and that does not involve you joining the Sith... at least not yet. I won't keep you from it. May the Force serve you well.",
      "nm39aayuth04030_.mp3": "That's... tempting, but I don't think I could. Your path... it goes somewhere I can't follow.",
      "nm39aayuth04033_.mp3": "[Success] I... suppose you could be right.",
      "nm39aayuth04034_.mp3": "[Failure] N-no... no, it's too late for me. Please... either let me go, or end it now.",
      "nm39aayuth04036_.mp3": "I didn't think you were here to train. Not really. I should have realized that sooner.",

      "nm35aalash07071_.mp3": "Remember: the central pillars in the valley. I'll be waiting, so don't take too long.",
      "nm35aalash07072_.mp3": "[Failure] How gullible to you believe me to be? The furthest tomb? Yeah right. Find your own prestige.",

      "nm35aabast06211_.mp3": "Aha. A na jakiej planecie się urodziłeś?",
      "nm35aabast06217_.mp3": "Cieszę się, że byłeś ze mną szczery. Potraktowałeś tę sprawę z należytą powagą. Więź, która nas łączy, ma wpływ na nasze przeznaczenie -  nie wolno jej lekceważyć.",
      "nm35aabast06229_.mp3": "Rozumiem. Nie chciałam cię zdenerwować, ale to było nieuniknione. Na pewno wiele przeszedłeś od naszej ucieczki z Taris. Przepraszam.",
      "nm35aabast06232_.mp3": "Tak. Skąd wiedziałeś?",
      "nm35aabast06241_.mp3": "Nie żartuj sobie z tego! Wybory, których dokonasz, mogą mieć wpływ na losy nas obojga, nie wspominając już o losie Republiki i całej galaktyki! Stawka jest ogromna.",
      "nm35aabast06254_.mp3": "Dobrze to usłyszeć. Jednak obawiam się, że bez odpowiedniego szkolenia będzie to dla ciebie bardzo trudne. Nawet jeśli masz dobre intencje. Oboje nas czeka wielkie niebezpieczeństwo.",
      "nm35aabast06257_.mp3": "To nieprawda. Martwię się o siebie, ale i o ciebie. Wolałabym, żeby żadnemu z nas nie stało się nic złego.",
      "nm35aabast06268_.mp3": "Dlaczego wciąż nie możesz zrozumieć, że między nami istnieje więź? Czy ci się to podoba, czy też nie, jesteśmy ze sobą związani... Dowiodła tego wizja Gwiezdnej Mapy, która się nam obojgu ukazała.",
      "nm35aabast06272_.mp3": "Jestem Jedi? Potrafię ukryć swoje emocje. Oboje wiemy, dlaczego potrafisz odgadnąć moje myśli. To przez łączącą nas więź.",
      "nm35aabast06294_.mp3": "Prawdą jest, że dzięki mojej Bitewnej medytacji wybrano mnie do oddziału uderzeniowego Jedi, którzy dostali się na statek Revana. Ale go nie zabiliśmy.",
      "nm35aabast06296_.mp3": "Naszym celem było pojmanie Revana. To Malak zwrócił się przeciw własnemu mistrzowi i oddał salwę prosto w statek Revana, kiedy wciąż byliśmy na jego pokładzie.",
      "nm35aabast06297_.mp3": "Zaślepiło go pragnienie zabicia nas i swojego mistrza. Na szczęście w ostatnim momencie udało się nam opuścić statek, zanim nastąpiła eksplozja.",
      "nm35aabast06299_.mp3": "Jak już mówiłam, mieliśmy tylko pojmać Revana. Jedi nie zabijają swoich jeńców. Nikt, bez względu na swoje zbrodnie, nie zasługuje na egzekucję.",
      "nm35aabast06301_.mp3": "Wybacz. Nie powinniśmy już o tym mówić. Wspomnienie mojego spotkania z Revanem jest dla mnie... bolesne. Zajmijmy się naszą misją.",
      "nm35aabast06303_.mp3": "Pewnie masz rację. Ale przebieg bitwy był... nieoczekiwany. Dla nas wszystkich. Takiego końca Revana nikt... nie przewidział.",
      "nm35aabast06310_.mp3": "Musisz się przygotować do tego, by stawić czoła Malakowi. Ta konfrontacja nie będzie łatwa. Pamiętam, jak trudne było moje pierwsze starcie z Revanem.",
      "nm35aabast06347_.mp3": "To ty chciałeś, żebym ci opowiedziała o rodzinie! Jeśli zmieniłeś zdanie, to lepiej będzie, jeśli zajmiemy się naszą misją.",
      "nm35aabast06365_.mp3": "Tak. Obserwowałam cię. Przyglądałam się uważnie, jakie postępy poczyniłeś od czasu szkolenia u mistrza Zhara.",
      "nm35aabast06367_.mp3": "Widziałam, jak wiele razy opierałeś się pokusom i podążałeś ścieżką Jasnej Strony. To godne pochwały, choć boję się, żebyś z tej ścieżki nie zbłądził.",
      "nm35aabast06371_.mp3": "Musimy. I to dla naszego dobra. Gdybyś przeszedł prawdziwe szkolenie, wszystko to byś już wiedział. Ale z powodu naszej misji to ja muszę ci  pomóc to zrozumieć.",
      "nm35aabast06377_.mp3": "Ciemna Strona staje się silniejsza i bardziej podstępna, im bardziej się do niej zbliżysz. Błaga cię, byś jej uległ - byś uwolnił jej okropną potęgę... i coraz trudniej się jej oprzeć.",
      "nm35aabast06378_.mp3": "A kiedy przestaniesz się opierać, jest już za późno. Ona zmienia twoje wnętrze... Zamienia cię w karykaturę tego, o co kiedyś walczyłeś.",
      "nm35aabast06402_.mp3": "Wydaje ci się, że zrozumiałeś, ale według mnie trochę sobie tę sprawę lekceważysz. Potęga Ciemnej Strony jest bardzo... kusząca.",
      "nm35aabast06435_.mp3": "Ja to zaczęłam? To ty poruszyłeś sprawę Rady Jedi! To ty poddałeś w wątpliwość sens naszej misji! To ty naigrywałeś się z tego, że podejrzewam Radę o to, że poddaje mnie próbie!",
      "nm35aabast06463_.mp3": "Rozumiem. W jaki sposób mogłabym ci to wynagrodzić? Wolałabym, żebyśmy zostali przyjaciółmi.",
      "nm35aabast06469_.mp3": "Ale wciąż chcę, żebyś był moim przyjacielem. Ale... to nie może być nic więcej. To zabronione.",
      "nm35aabast06492_.mp3": "Nawet nie zaczynaj. To ty zacząłeś tę rozmowę. Wcale nie chciałam ci nic mówić. Ale teraz, gdy już poruszyłeś tę sprawę, widzę, że nie powinnam tak długo z tym zwlekać.",
      "nm35aabast06526_.mp3": "Nie jestem odpowiednią Jedi do tego, by cię uczyć. Daleko mi do mistrza. Powinieneś był pozostać z Radą.",
      "nm35aabast06539_.mp3": "Nie opuścisz mnie, prawda? Mimo że cię odpychałam, zostałeś przy mnie, kiedy cię najbardziej potrzebuję.",
      "nm35aabast06554_.mp3": "Byłeś dla mnie bardzo cierpliwy. Zasługujesz na odpowiedź. Ale musisz zrozumieć, jak trudno przychodzą mi te słowa.",
      "nm35aabast06567_.mp3": "Gdybym mógł, wróciłbym na Dantooine. Chcę się uwolnić od tej naszej więzi. Osłabić ją. Chcę być gdziekolwiek, byle tylko z dala od ciebie!",
      "nm35aabast06586_.mp3": "O, a ja myślałam... Nie, to dobrze. Cieszę się, że mi to powiedziałeś. To znacznie wszystko upraszcza.",
      "nm35aabast06598_.mp3": "Nie przeczę, że coś w tobie - twoja siła woli i energia - mnie do ciebie ciągnie. Jesteś o wiele silniejszy ode mnie.",
      "nm35aabast06614_.mp3": "Jesteś silniejszy, niż mi się wydawało. Nie musisz mi nic mówić. Mam nadzieję, że kiedyś będziesz wielkim Jedi.",
      "nm35aabast06617_.mp3": "Jestem pewna, że sam też sobie poradzisz.",
      "nm37aafree04049_.mp3": "A co to? Zjawa... silna Mocą. Bądź ostrożny. W tej postaci kryje się bardzo stary i zagubiony umysł...",
      "nm40aabast01000_.mp3": "Nie ruszaj się zbyt szybko, nie jesteś jeszcze w pełni sił. Admirał Karath kazał strażnikom cię dalej torturować, nawet po tym, jak straciłeś przytomność.",
      "nm40aabast01013_.mp3": "Szkoda, że nie udało ci się oprzeć admirałowi. Mam nadzieję, że informacje, które mu wyjawiłeś, nie umożliwią Sithom przejęcia władzy nad całą galaktyką.",
      "nm40aabast01016_.mp3": "Miałeś dobre zamiary, ale się nie zastanowiłeś - Saul i tak nas wszystkich torturował. Stawka jest zbyt wysoka, żebyś mógł pozwalać nierozważnym namiętnościom determinować twoje działania.",
      "nm40aabast01038_.mp3": "Cieszę się, że byłeś w stanie oprzeć się admirałowi. Los galaktyki może zależeć od najmniejszej nawet informacji.",
      "nm40aabast01065_.mp3": "Więc jesteś głupi! Moc Mrocznego Lorda jest wystarczająco potężna, żeby pokonać każdego z nas... nawet ciebie. Walka z nim tutaj byłaby samobójstwem! Musimy uciec, zanim tu dotrze.",
      "nm40acdart03028_.mp3": "To prawda. Byłam częścią zespołu wysłanego, by pojmać Revana... by pojmać ciebie. Kiedy Malak zaatakował statek, zostałeś poważnie ranny. Myśleliśmy, że nie żyjesz.",
      "nm40acdart03047_.mp3": "Nie mogliśmy tak po prostu przywrócić twojej starej tożsamości - Revan był zbyt niebezpieczny. Ale wewnątrz twojego umysłu były informacje, których Republika potrzebowała - sekrety Gwiezdnej Kuźni.",
      "nm41aabast01010_.mp3": "Moc obdarzyła nas... jakąś wizją. Podobną do tej, którą mieliśmy na Dantooine. Widziałeś? Oczywiście... musiałeś. Moc silna jest w nas obojgu.",
      "nm41aabast01036_.mp3": "Czułeś to, prawda? Kolejna wizja? Moc nadal nami kieruje, pokazuje nam Gwiezdne Mapy, które odnaleźli Revan i Malak.",
      "nm41aacart04061_.mp3": "Rada Jedi zawiodła, Carth - Darth Revan się odrodził! Razem zniszczymy Malaka i przejmiemy kontrolę nad jego flotą, a później użyjemy jej do zgniecenia Republiki!",
      "nm41aacart04062_.mp3": "Juhani i Jolee nie chcieli przysiąc wierności nowemu władcy Sithów. Zginęli za swoją głupotę. A teraz przysięgnij wierność Darthowi Revanowi albo zginiesz.",
      "nm41aacart04081_.mp3": "Roboty wciąż będą ci służyć, Revanie - są zaprogramowane, by służyć swojemu panu. Może inni też do nas dołączą.",
      "nm41aacart04082_.mp3": "Republika jest zgubiona, Revan powrócił! Kto przysięgnie wierność powracającemu Mrocznemu Władcy?",
      "nm41aamiss04027_.mp3": "Wyśmienicie, Lordzie Revan. Jesteś równie okrutny jak kiedyś Malak! A teraz szybko, musimy dotrzeć na Gwiezdną Kuźnię i zgładzić uzurpatora!",
      "nm44acc01001000_.mp3": "Malak is dead - all hail the return of Darth Revan, the true Lord of the Sith!",
      "nm44acc01001001_.mp3": "The Sith bow before you, you have reclaimed your rightful throne! The Jedi Order is in tatters, ## it is only a matter of time until your Sith minions wipe them from the face of the galaxy. ## The Republic fleet is decimated, the Core Worlds are defenseless against us!",
      "nm44acevil01001_.mp3": "Revanie - wiedziałam, że po mnie przyjdziesz. Malak myślał, że być może nie odważysz się ponownie wejść do Świątyni, ale nie zna cię tak dobrze jak ja. Już nie. Nie, od kiedy się zmieniłeś.",
      "nm44acevil01017_.mp3": "Jesteś żałosnym małym głupcem. Mówisz, jakbym była tą samą Bastilą, którą kiedyś znałeś. Ale uwolniona spod kontroli Rady Jedi stałam się kimś zupełnie innym.",
      "nm44acevil01018_.mp3": "Prawie chciałabym, abyś mógł spojrzeć na wszystko tak jak ja. Chciałabym, żebyś do mnie dołączył i jeszcze raz zasmakował prawdziwej potęgi. Niestety, wątpię, byś był do tego zdolny.",
      "nm44acevil01022_.mp3": "Kłamstwom? Ty jesteś wcieleniem kłamstwa, Revanie. Rada Jedi uczyniła cię kimś, kim nie jesteś - zaprogramowali cię, byś był ich niewolnikiem.",
      "nm44acevil01024_.mp3": "Kiedyś byłeś Revanem, mistrzem Sithów, ale to przeszłość. Jesteś tylko pionkiem Rady Jedi i Republiki, której służą... tak jak ja, zanim Malak nie wyzwolił mnie spod ich jarzma.",
      "nm44acevil01026_.mp3": "Szkoda, że twoja potęga tak osłabła. Mogłeś być tak silny jak ja teraz... nawet silniejszy. Ale to już się nie stanie.",
      "nm44acevil01031_.mp3": "Jesteś silniejszy, niż się spodziewałam, mimo tego, co zrobiła ci Rada Jedi. Zdaje się, że Malak był w błędzie - potęga Ciemnej Strony nie jest dla ciebie stracona, Revanie.",
      "nm44acevil01034_.mp3": "Pamiętaj: Byłam przy tym, jak omal nie zginąłeś w pułapce zastawionej przez Radę Jedi. Użyłam Mocy, by utrzymać cię przy życiu, Revanie. To, co zrobiłam na mostku, połączyło nas na zawsze.",
      "nm44acevil01041_.mp3": "Zasługujesz na bycie prawdziwym mistrzem Sithów, nie Malak. Teraz to widzę. Wspólnie możemy zniszczyć twojego dawnego ucznia. Dołącz do mnie i odzyskaj utraconą tożsamość!",
      "nm44acevil01043_.mp3": "Twój umysł został zbyt poważnie uszkodzony, byś w pełni odzyskał wspomnienia, Revanie. Ale twoja potęga, siła woli, esencja tego, kim i czym jesteś - one nie zniknęły!",
      "nm44acevil01044_.mp3": "Dawno temu sprzeciwiłeś się Radzie Jedi, uwalniając się spod ich kontroli. Sięgnąłeś po należny ci tytuł Mrocznego Władcy Sithów. Razem możemy pokonać Malaka i odebrać mu to, co należy się tobie!",
      "nm44acevil01046_.mp3": "Niczego... nie czuję. Uszanuję tylko Revana, który uwolnił się spod władzy Rady. Tego, który sięgnie po potęgę, jaką ma w zasięgu ręki... a nie słabego głupca przede mną.",
      "nm44acevil01050_.mp3": "Ale ty, Revanie - ty możesz władać Ciemną Stroną! Możesz użyć jej do zniszczenia Malaka! Z moją pomocą możesz rządzić galaktyką!",
      "nm44acevil01057_.mp3": "Zamknij się, starcze! Twój czas minął! Skończyła się era Jedi i Republiki! Nadeszła era Dartha Revana i Sithów!",
      "nm44acevil01067_.mp3": "Tak! Krew ofiar poświęci starożytną świątynię w imieniu Sithów! Wraz ze śmiercią Jedi dokona się odrodzenie Dartha Revana!",
      "nm44acevil01078_.mp3": "Ale wykazałeś się w naszej walce - widzę, że posiadasz siłę zdolną do zniszczenia Malaka i odzyskania pozycji Mrocznego Władcy. Teraz widzę, że będziesz wspaniałym mistrzem Sithów.",
      "nm44acevil01081_.mp3": "Jesteś załosnym głupcem, Revanie! Razem moglibyśmy pokonać Malaka i rządzić Imperium, ale zamiast tego stanę po stronie Lorda Malaka!",
      "nm44acevil01091_.mp3": "Naszej więzi nie da się łatwo zerwać, Revanie. Nasza więź przetrwała nawet wtedy, gdy twój umysł został zniszczony i przeprogramowany na nową tożsamość.",
      "nm44acevil01096_.mp3": "Tak, Revanie! Byłam tak, gdy omal nie zginąłeś w pułapce zastawionej przez Radę Jedi. Użyłam Mocy, by uratować ci życie. To, co zrobiłam tam, na mostku, połączyło nas na zawsze.",
      "nm45aabast01006_.mp3": "Wiem, że to prawda. Gdybyś przyjął moc swojej poprzedniej tożsamości, byłabym twoim adeptem, a nie Malaka. Ale ty odrzuciłeś Ciemną Stronę.",
      "nm45aabast01116_.mp3": "Powodzenia, kochany... i niech Moc będzie z tobą.",
      "nm45aabast01166_.mp3": "Gwiezdną Kuźnię atakuje cała flota Republiki! Jeśli nie użyję Bitewnej medytacji, żeby przechylić szalę zwycięstwa, Gwiezdna Kuźnia zostanie zniszczona przez statki admirał Dodonny.",
      "nm45aabast01167_.mp3": "Muszę zostać w centrum dowodzenia, żeby jak najlepiej wykorzystać swoją Bitewną medytację. Jeśli tego nie zrobię, Gwiezdna Kuźnia będzie zgubiona!",
      "nm45aabast01168_.mp3": "Sam musisz się z mierzyć z Malakiem. Odszukaj go, zabij i zdobądź tytuł Mrocznego Lorda Sithów!",
      "nm45aadrkj03001_.mp3": "Błądzą ci, którzy nadal wierzą w Malaka. Przejrzyj wreszcie na oczy i poznaj prawdziwego Mistrza Sith - Revan powrócił!"

      "nm35aajole09113_.mp3": "Oczywiście, że musisz. Wiem dużo rzeczy, pamiętasz? Myślisz, że poradziłbyś sobie beze mnie w tej części galaktyki? Nie odpowiadaj na to pytanie.",

      "nm35aajole09144_.mp3": "Przypominam, że to *ty* zacząłeś wyciągać ze mnie informacje. Jakby staruszek nie miał nic lepszego do roboty. Hm.",
      "nm35aajole09158_.mp3": "Wykręcać? Ja się wykręcam? He, he. Widać, że nigdy nie próbowałeś złapać twi'lekiańskiej tancerki po wypiciu kilku szklanek soku ondarańskich willeków.",
      "nm35aajole09166_.mp3": "To mi ulżyło. Może staruszek wreszcie będzie miał trochę spokoju. A teraz zmykaj już i wracaj do tego, co robiłeś wcześniej.",
      "nm35aajole09171_.mp3": "A poza tym... nie chcesz tego słuchać. Mówimy tu o czasach starożytnych, pewnie zanim się urodziłeś. Historia nudzi dzieci, to udowodniony fakt.",
      "nm35aajole09177_.mp3": "Tak, tak, byłem awanturnikiem. Zadowolony? Wtedy jeszcze nie zakończył się mój trening Jedi. Miałem wielką czuprynę i chciałem zobaczyć dosłownie wszystko.",
      "nm35aajole09182_.mp3": "Takiś pewny? Rety, rety, musisz być bardzo oczytany i doświadczony, skoro wiesz tyle rzeczy. W każdym razie byłem wtedy jeszcze padawanem.",

      "nm35aajole09214_.mp3": "Nie bądź głupi. Czy ty nic nie robisz? Jeśli nic ciebie nie zadowala, to nie ma najmniejszego powodu, dla którego wtedy miałoby zadowolić mnie.",
      "nm35aajole09223_.mp3": "Pozwól, że coś ci powiem. Kiedy będziesz mieć tyle lat, co ja, będziesz miał długą, długą listę wspomnień.",
      "nm35aajole09224_.mp3": "Jeśli będziesz miał szczęście, większość z nich będzie dobra. Jeśli nie, to kilka będzie złych. A jeśli będziesz miał pecha, niektóre będą tak złe, że nie będziesz chciał ich nigdy wspominać.",
      "nm35aajole09225_.mp3": "Odejdziesz gdzieś daleko, do miejsca, z którym nie masz związanych żadnych wspomnień. I tam będziesz szczęśliwy, bo zapomnisz i będziesz zapomniany.",
      "nm35aajole09232_.mp3": "Możesz mówić o sobie jeszcze gorzej z jeszcze lepszych powodów. Jeśli nie uważasz, że możliwe jest, byś kiedyś mówił tak o sobie, to jesteś młodszy niż podejrzewałem.",
      "nm35aajole09233_.mp3": "Pozwól, że cię o coś zapytam - czy kiedyś tak naprawdę kochałeś? Tak naprawdę, nie mówię o zwykłym zadurzeniu.",
      "nm35aajole09252_.mp3": "Powiem ci tylko jedno - nieważne, jak bardzo byś się starał, czasami ty i osoba, którą kochasz, nie jesteście sobie pisani.",
      "nm35aajole09272_.mp3": "Hm, najwyraźniej nie jesteś tak głupi, jak się czasem zachowujesz. Bez wątpienia jednak przynajmniej raz byłeś na drugim końcu sprawiedliwości Jedi, co?",
      "nm35aajole09306_.mp3": "Opowieść jest o ślepocie, myślałem, że to jasne. W każdym razie zastanów się nad tym. To ty mnie zapytałeś, dlaczego Jedi mnie opuścili, pamiętasz?",
      "nm35aajole09309_.mp3": "Zważywszy, że dotyczy ślepoty, to dość spodziewana odpowiedź. To ty mnie zapytałeś, dlaczego Jedi mnie opuścili, pamiętasz?",
      "nm35aajole09313_.mp3": "Cholera, przecież to ty pytałeś mnie o Jedi! Chcesz usłyszeć historię, czy nie?",
      "nm35aajole09322_.mp3": "Naprawdę? Hm. Są momenty, kiedy myślę, że musisz być starszy niż wyglądasz... Ale ten moment do nich nie należy.",
      "nm35aajole09331_.mp3": "Nie nadymaj się tak, do cholery! Gdybyś raczył mnie słuchać, to zrozumiałbyś, że to nie ja opuściłem Zakon. To Zakon opuścił *mnie*.",
      "nm35aajole09341_.mp3": "Och... prawda. Szlag by trafił słuch młodzików! Miałem nadzieję, że nie uważałeś, kiedy o tym wspomniałem.",
      "nm35aajole09462_.mp3": "Hm. Na początku miałem problemy. Sam widziałeś, jakie stworzenia się tam panoszą... a i tak nie poznałeś tych największych.",
      "nm35aajole09497_.mp3": "A dziękuję. Ty też nie jesteś taki zły, zważywszy na wszystko.",
      "nm35aajole09505_.mp3": "Nie sądzisz, że powinniśmy ruszać dalej? Gdybyś siedział bezczynnie w Krainach Cienia tyle czasu, to jakiś tach zacząłby cię podgryzać.",

      "nm40adcart01058_.mp3": "Ale czy to cokolwiek zmienia? Nie jestem tu po to, żeby ciebie oceniać. Zrobisz, co będziesz musiał zrobić, a ja ci pomogę, jeśli tylko będę mógł.",
      "nm40adcart01079_.mp3": "Można by pomyśleć, że nigdy wcześniej nie słyszałeś o Mocy. Dla mnie to oczywiste, że takie właśnie było twoje przeznaczenie.",
      "nm41aablac01018_.mp3": "Momencik - rozumiesz te stworzenia? Musiałeś nauczyć się ich języka, kiedy byłeś tu w poszukiwaniu tajemnic Gwiezdnej Kuźni. Kiedy jeszcze byłeś Revanem.",
      "nm41aacart03126_.mp3": "Obawiam się, że ciężko jej będzie oprzeć się pokusie Ciemnej Strony. Bastila jest silna Mocą, ale jest też porywcza, uparta i dumna - tak jak ty kiedyś, Revanie.",
      "nm41aacart03136_.mp3": "Pamiętam... choć miałem nadzieję, że powrót do przeszłej tożsamości nie przyjdzie ci tak łatwo. Jeśli Bastila pójdzie w twoje ślady, to już ją straciliśmy, Revanie.",
      "nm41adguid01003_.mp3": "Chwila... nie możesz pójść tam sam.",
      "nm41adguid01009_.mp3": "Twoje przeznaczenie - a może i los całej galaktyki - może zostać na zawsze zmieniony w tej Świątyni. Nie pozwolę, byś zmierzył się z tym samotnie. Nie po tej wizji. Jest powód, dla którego miałem tę wizję.",
      "nm44acevil01080_.mp3": "Nie! Nie kieruj się gniewem. Bądź spokojny, skoncentrowany. Nie pozwól, by zawładnęła twoim umysłem!"

      "nglobebant00011_.mp3": "Bastilo, myślałaś kiedyś o tym, żeby przyłączyć się do tych wszystkich Jedi, którzy poszli w ślady Revana i Malaka, gdy ci dwaj wyruszyli, aby walczyć z Mandalorianami?",
      "nglobecart04933_.mp3": "Dlaczego to zrobiłeś? Czasami... nie mogę pojąć, skąd w tobie tyle okrucieństwa.",
      "nm01aacart01008_.mp3": "Zdążyłeś w ostatniej chwili! Została tylko jedna kapsuła ratunkowa. Dalej. Możemy się ukryć na planecie, nad którą się teraz znajdujemy!",
      "nm02aacart02000_.mp3": "Hej, zaczekaj. Nie próbuj jeszcze wstawać. Nieźle się potłukłeś, kiedy rozbiliśmy się na Taris.",
      "nm02aacart02001_.mp3": "Spokojnie, w tym mieszkaniu powinniśmy być bezpieczni. Dam ci coś na sen. Postaraj się odpocząć, resztę niech zrobią pakiety kolto.",
      "nm02aacart02005_.mp3": "Przez kilka dni byłeś nieprzytomny. Nic dziwnego, że jesteś nieco zdezorientowany. Nie przejmuj się. Jesteśmy bezpieczni... przynajmniej na razie.",
      "nm02aacart02006_.mp3": "Jesteśmy w opuszczonym mieszkaniu na Taris. Nieźle się potłukłeś, kiedy nasza kapsuła ratunkowa się rozbiła, na szczęście nie były to poważne obrażenia.",
      "nm02aacart02016_.mp3": "Uderzenie w głowę było poważniejsze, niż przypuszczałem. Bastila jest Jedi. Była w grupie uderzeniowej, która zabiła Dartha Revana. A Revan to przecież dawny mistrz Malaka.",
      "nm02aacart02040_.mp3": "Kiedy leżałeś nieprzytomny, rozejrzałem się trochę po okolicy. Podobno kilka kapsuł ratunkowych rozbiło się w Podmieście. To dobre miejsce do rozpoczęcia poszukiwań.",
      "nm02aacart02052_.mp3": "Rozumiem, dlaczego chciałbyś wiedzieć więcej o mnie - mam... mam wrażenie, że spędzimy razem sporo czasu.",
      "nm02aacart02055_.mp3": "Wszystko, co wiem o Malaku, to ogólnie znane informacje. Udało mu się uniknąć pułapki, w której zginął Darth Revan, jego mistrz Sithów. Po śmierci Revana Malak został nowym Mrocznym Lordem.",
      "nm02aacart02056_.mp3": "Malak jest bezlitosnym tyranem, który zniszczy każdego, kto stanie na jego drodze... niczym nie różni się od Revana. Sithowie nie spoczną, dopóki nie zniszczą Republiki.",
      "nm02aacart02061_.mp3": "Stworzyli armię z eks-żołnierzy Republiki i Jedi, którzy przeszli na Ciemną Stronę, na jej czele stał Revan... dopóki nie został zabity przez grupę Jedi dowodzonych przez Bastilę.",
      "nm02aacart02062_.mp3": "Niestety, nie powstrzymało to Sithów na długo. Malak przejął dowodzenie po Revanie. Stojąc na czele armady Sithów, wznowił krwawy podbój Odległych Rubieży.",
      "nm02aacart02067_.mp3": "Obyś miał rację. Niestety, do tej pory Republika nie mogła powstrzymać Sithów, nawet z pomocą Rady Jedi. Być może Bastila jest ostatnią nadzieją galaktyki.",
      "nm02aacart02089_.mp3": "Zwariowałeś! Samemu nie uda ci się opuścić tej planety, nie możesz też ukrywać się w nieskończoność. Czy zdajesz sobie sprawę, co zrobią z tobą Sithowie, kiedy cię odnajdą?",
      "nm02aacart02096_.mp3": "Chyba nie zrozumiałeś naszej sytuacji. Nie możemy ukrywać się w nieskończoność. W końcu Sithowie nas znajdą... i uwierz mi, nie chciałbyś, żeby tak się stało.",
      "nm02aacart02101_.mp3": "Nie jestem zaskoczony. Odniosłeś poważne obrażenia głowy. Prawdopodobnie miałeś niejeden dziwny sen. Na twoim miejscu nie przejmowałbym się tym zbytnio.",
      "nm02abjani11121_.mp3": "W dzisiejszych czasach ludzie powinni być bardziej tolerancyjni. *wzdycha* Chyba głupota i ignorancja nigdy nie wyjdzie z mody.",

      "nm02aczelk11026_.mp3": "Wiem, że kilka dodatkowych kredytów mogłoby nam pomóc, ale nie pochwalam twoich metod. Zelka to dobry człowiek.... nie powinieneś go tak traktować.",

      "nm03aakand01050_.mp3": "Jesteś pewien? Chcę odzyskać Bastilę... ale przyjmowanie zleceń zabójstwa to trochę za wiele. Nawet jeśli celem jest jakiś śmieć.",
      "nm03ae_zax22196_.mp3": "Wiesz co, nie jestem przekonany co do tych \"specjalnych\" kontraktów Davika. Sprawiedliwość to jedno, a odwalanie czarnej roboty dla jakiegoś pana półświatka to już co innego.",
      "nm04aaigea07074_.mp3": "Odnoszę wrażenie, że gdyby nie Gendar, to byłoby tu jeszcze gorzej.",
      "nm04aaigea07075_.mp3": "Bądź ostrożny. Coś mi się w tym gościu nie podoba. Nie zaufałbym mu bardziej niż Jawie w dziupli ze skradzionymi robotami.",

      "nm08aahudr11043_.mp3": "Ten statek może nam być potrzebny. Jesteś pewien, że nie powinniśmy go wypuszczać?",
      "nm12aac02001001_.mp3": "Krążownik przechwytujący Sithów. Czekali, aż wyjdziemy z nadprzestrzeni. Złapali nas promieniem ściągającym.",
      "nm12aac02001003_.mp3": "To Lewiatan. Pojazd Saula Karatha. Mojego dawnego mentora.",
      "nm13aacart02006_.mp3": "Cóż, Bastila wspomniała przed odejściem, że powinieneś iść do komnat Rady. To na pewno pilna sprawa, dlatego lepiej nie każ im na siebie czekać.",
      "nm14acbolo01023_.mp3": "He, he... to zabawne, ale czy nie powinieneś podchodzić do tego poważnie?",
      "nm14acbolo01346_.mp3": "Dobrze się spisałeś. Kto wie, może jeszcze będzie z ciebie Jedi?",
      "nm17aa03sh01059_.mp3": "Czemu to zrobiłeś!? Na Moc, przecież te kredyty nie są nam aż tak potrzebne!",
      "nm23adfrey02087_.mp3": "Zrobiłeś to. Nie uda ci się przekonać go do tego.",
      "nm25aacomp01255_.mp3": "Chcesz powiedzieć, że pozwoliłbyś, by ci wszyscy ludzie zginęli? To potworne!",
      "nm33aacart04662_.mp3": "Na pewno nie miałeś złych zamiarów, pytając o moją przeszłość. Po prostu nie przywykłem o tym rozmawiać.",
      "nm33aacart04663_.mp3": "Przecież sam chciałeś, żebym ci o sobie opowiedział. Właśnie taki jestem.",
      "nm33aacart04668_.mp3": "Jak chciałeś mnie przesłuchać, trzeba było od razu tak mówić?",
      "nm33aacart04670_.mp3": "Wjechałeś mi na męską dumę, więc jakże miałbym się oprzeć? Cha, cha! Dobra, postawiłeś na swoim. Możesz zacząć przesłuchanie.",
      "nm33aacart04672_.mp3": "Tylko żartowałem, choć naprawdę wyglądasz, jakbyś miał do mnie setki pytań. Szczerze mówiąc, to miła odmiana.",
      "nm33aacart04678_.mp3": "Parę rzeczy mi się nie klei. Może ty mógłbyś mi opowiedzieć, co się stało... z twojej perspektywy.",
      "nm33aacart04685_.mp3": "Dobra, dobra. Cholernie jesteś uparty, wiesz?",
      "nm33aacart04694_.mp3": "Auć. Tym razem zraniłeś moją męską dumę.",
      "nm33aacart04696_.mp3": "Pewnie masz rację. Ulżyłeś sobie?",
      "nm33aacart04700_.mp3": "*wzdycha* Posłuchaj... Próbuję ci tylko powiedzieć, że gdybyś miał choć trochę oleju w głowie, też byś nikomu nie ufał... ani mnie, ani Bastili, a już zwłaszcza sobie samemu.",
      "nm33aasith20008_.mp3": "Tak, racja. Dobra, jesteś wolny. Chodźmy, chłopaki.",
      "nm33aasith20015_.mp3": "Ach, dobra. Chodźmy. Masz farta, nieznajomy.",
      "nm33abacad01008_.mp3": "Nie bardziej niż nasz \"pan\".",
      "nm33abcart04782_.mp3": "Nie mogę uwierzyć, że on nie żyje. Powinienem był go powstrzymać! Ty też powinieneś był coś zrobić, żeby temu zapobiec!",
      "nm33abcart04784_.mp3": "Nie udawaj niewiniątka! Potrafiłbyś nawet wyciągnąć forsę od Hutta - mogłeś coś zrobić... mogłeś go ocalić!",
      "nm33abcart04793_.mp3": "To nieprawda. Ty też go zawiodłeś. Szkoda, że cię w ogóle spotkałem.",
      "nm33abcart04800_.mp3": "Czasami mam wątpliwości, po której ty właściwie jesteś stronie. Ale... to nie tylko ty jesteś temu winien. To przede wszystkim ja za to odpowiadam.",
      "nm33abcart04803_.mp3": "Dlaczego nie chciałeś mi pomóc? Doskonale wiedziałeś, jak bardzo mi zależy na odnalezieniu Dustila! Pomagałeś innym, dlaczego nie jemu? Dlaczego nie mnie?",
      "nm33abcart04805_.mp3": "Mogłeś. Ale... nie tylko ty ponosisz za to winę. To przede wszystkim ja za to odpowiadam.",
      "nm33abcart04811_.mp3": "Gdybym był wściekły, na pewno nie musiałbyś o to pytać. Na razie niech cię o to głowa nie boli.",
      "nm33abcart04814_.mp3": "Coś ty taki zasadniczy? Czy te pytania naprawdę są takie ważne?",
      "nm33abcart04815_.mp3": "Zamieniam się w słuch, przystojniaku.",
      "nm33abcart04817_.mp3": "Co? To, że zamieniam się w słuch, czy ten tekst z \"przystojniakiem\"?",
      "nm33abcart04840_.mp3": "Ja... *wzdycha* Dobra, poddaje się. Wygrałeś.",
      "nm33abcart04910_.mp3": "A *to* akurat chętnie bym zobaczył. Choć... Może lepiej nie. Zamieszałeś mi w głowie, wiesz?",
      "nm33abcart04914_.mp3": "Co? Nie! To znaczy... nie! Oszalałeś?!",
      "nm33abcart04920_.mp3": "A miałeś kiedykolwiek co do tego jakieś wątpliwości?",
      "nm35aacart04005_.mp3": "Czego chcesz?",
      "nm35aacart04039_.mp3": "Wolę działać... Lepiej zajmijmy się naszym zadaniem. Jeśli będziesz miał więcej pytań, odpowiem na nie później.",
      "nm35aacart04048_.mp3": "To prawda. Bastila zasługuje na to, co o niej mówią - to w końcu ona pokonała Dartha Revana.",
      "nm35aacart04055_.mp3": "Nie bądź śmieszny. Od kiedy rozbiliśmy się na Taris nie raz pokazałeś, na co cię stać... Bez ciebie nie zaszlibyśmy tak daleko. Ale mimo to...",
      "nm35aacart04081_.mp3": "Przemytnikiem? Powinienem się domyślić. Czy to nie dziwne, że przemytnik, którego w ostatniej chwili dodano do mojej załogi, jakimś cudem wyszedł z tego wszystkiego cało?",
      "nm35aacart04085_.mp3": "Pewnie, że nie... Chyba że wziąć pod uwagę to, że dodali cię do załogi w ostatnim momencie i tak się złożyło, że znalazłeś się wśród ocalałych.",
      "nm35aacart04093_.mp3": "Masz umiejętności zawodowego komandosa. Nieraz ocaliłeś mi tyłek. Tak między nami - mam niezłego farta, że z nami jesteś.",
      "nm35aacart04121_.mp3": "Wcale nie chcę, żebyś mi ufał. Gdybyś miał choć trochę oleju w głowie, nikomu byś nie ufał... ani mnie, ani Bastili, a już zwłaszcza sobie samemu.",
      "nm35aacart04125_.mp3": "Nie pamiętam, żebym kogokolwiek nazywał \"zdrajcą\". Jeśli masz choć trochę oleju w głowie, nie powinieneś nikomu ufać... ani mnie, ani Bastili, a już zwłaszcza sobie samemu.",
      "nm35aacart04127_.mp3": "Nie tobie pierwszemu. Słuchaj... wcale nie oczekuję, że zostaniemy kumplami. Taki już jestem. Nie bierz tego tak do siebie.",
      "nm35aacart04131_.mp3": "Co prawda *jeszcze* niczego nie zrobiłeś, ale nie ma żadnej gwarancji, co będzie w  przyszłości. Już nieraz padałem ofiarą zdrady i... nie dopuszczę, żeby ta historia się powtórzyła.",
      "nm35aacart04161_.mp3": "Wiem. Powinienem... cię przeprosić. Przyzwyczaiłem się, żeby się po innych spodziewać najgorszego, a tymczasem ty nie zrobiłeś nic, by na to zasłużyć.",
      "nm35aacart04168_.mp3": "Uroczy jesteś. Miło wiedzieć, że tak się o mnie martwisz. *wzdycha* W sumie pewnie by mi to nie zaszkodziło. Po prostu nie wiem, dlaczego cię to tak interesuje.",
      "nm35aacart04203_.mp3": "Więź? Jaka więź? Chcesz powiedzieć, że według nich jesteś w jakiś sposób \"związany\" z Bastilą? Hm. Jakoś trudno mi w to uwierzyć.",
      "nm35aacart04218_.mp3": "Obserwowałem cię... potrafisz być okrutny i porywczy. Jak na Jedi brakuje ci opanowania i szkolenia, a mimo to Rada zleca ci wykonanie zadanie? Dlaczego?",
      "nm35aacart04220_.mp3": "To nie ma nic do rzeczy. Jedi zachęcili cię, żebyś z nami został, a ja nie mogę jakoś uwierzyć w ich argumentację.",
      "nm35aacart04228_.mp3": "A to dlaczego? Na Taris faktycznie się przydałeś, ale dlaczego tak im zależy na tym, żebyś wciąż z nami był? Czy oni... czy oni nie musieli cię jakoś przeszkolić?",
      "nm35aacart04245_.mp3": "Załatwione! W takim razie ruszajmy w drogę... partnerze?",
      "nm35aacart04247_.mp3": "Nie rób się taki sentymentalny. *wzdycha* Zgoda. Ruszajmy.",
      "nm35aacart04271_.mp3": "W porządku. Nic nie szkodzi. Zasługiwałeś na jakieś... wytłumaczenie.",
      "nm35aacart04303_.mp3": "Nie o to mi... chodziło. Nie chcę, żeby któremuś z was stało się coś złego.",
      "nm35aacart04320_.mp3": "Ale czy na pewno nie ponieśli kary? Revan został zdradzony przez Malaka... a sam Malak nie odniósł zwycięstwa. W końcu się okaże, że Ciemna Strona jednak mu nie pomoże.",
      "nm35aacart04328_.mp3": "Przepraszam. Nie powinienem o niej wspominać, nawet jeśli o to prosiłeś. Po prostu... jakoś dobrze mi się z tobą rozmawia.",
      "nm35aacart04348_.mp3": "Nie masz prawa tak mówić. Nie mogę się pogodzić z jej śmiercią. I mam do tego prawo, zrozumiałeś?",
      "nm35aacart04350_.mp3": "Rozczulania? Wcale się nie... Dobra, może trochę się rozczulam, ale ty jesteś strasznie natrętny, wiesz?",
      "nm35aacart04385_.mp3": "Ha! Dlaczego mi o tym wcześniej nie powiedziałeś? Oszczędziłbyś mi kłopotu.",
      "nm35aacart04396_.mp3": "A ty moje przeprosiny przyjąłeś... ale to nie znaczy, że mi wybaczyłeś. A szkoda.",
      "nm35aacart04417_.mp3": "O ciebie. Boję się, co może cię spotkać. Masz dużo odwagi. Zadziwia mnie to, że wciąż jesteś taki silny, ale przed tobą jeszcze większe zagrożenie.",
      "nm35aacart04418_.mp3": "Sam się narażasz. Nie wiem, może to wpływ tych Jedi... ale na pewno czeka cię niebezpieczeństwo.",
      "nm35aacart04422_.mp3": "I tu się mylisz. Sam sobie nie poradzisz. Nikt nie byłby w stanie tego zrobić.",
      "nm35aacart04426_.mp3": "Wiem, że przyjdzie taki dzień, że spojrzysz w lustro i zastanowisz się, jak mogłeś stać się tym, kim jesteś... a wtedy będzie już za późno.",
      "nm35aacart04429_.mp3": "Jeśli ja mam żyć dłużej niż Saul, to ty także. Jesteś mi potrzebny. Będę cię chronił... przed tobą samym, przed Sithami... Pozwól mi spróbować.",
      "nm35aacart04439_.mp3": "Hm... W takim razie nie mam wyboru. Wciąż ci będę pomagał, o ile będę mógł... ale musisz sobie radzić sam.",
      "nm35aacart04444_.mp3": "Jak jesteś gotowy, żeby porozmawiać, to proszę bardzo.",
      "nm35aacart04451_.mp3": "Mimo że w twoim wnętrzu przebywa jakaś część Revana, mimo... tej ciemności, która w tobie jest, tak naprawdę jesteś kimś innym.",
      "nm35aacart04452_.mp3": "Właśnie dlatego nie mogę cię znienawidzić i nie chcę się już mścić. Nie musisz być Revanem - możesz być kimś więcej. Cokolwiek zrobili ci Jedi, dali ci tę szansę.",
      "nm35aacart04456_.mp3": "Chcę, żebyś dokonał właściwego wyboru. Może moja obecność się do tego przyczyni.",
      "nm35aacart04458_.mp3": "Wtedy, miejmy nadzieję, uda mi się ciebie uratować. Przed tobą samym.",
      "nm35aacart04460_.mp3": "Dałeś mi przyszłość. Chcę tego samego dla ciebie... ze mną przy twoim boku. Gdybyś dał mi szansę, to mógłbym cię pokochać.",
      "nm35aacart04478_.mp3": "Może nie powinieneś. Może się mylę, ale mam nadzieję, że moja pomoc coś dla ciebie znaczy.",
      "nm35aacart04481_.mp3": "Nie jestem pewien. Chyba sam potrafisz się tego domyślić, co?",
      "nm35aacart04729_.mp3": "Cały czas próbuję ci powiedzieć, że nie mam nic do ciebie osobiście. Gdybyś miał choć trochę oleju w głowie, też byś nikomu nie ufał... ani mnie, ani Bastili, a już zwłaszcza sobie samemu.",
      "nm35aacart04737_.mp3": "Może wcale nie chciałem. A ty byś przewidział?",
      "nm35aacart04749_.mp3": "He, he! Coś ty taki poważny? Może wolisz, żebym zwracał się do ciebie inaczej?",
      "nm35aacart04759_.mp3": "Auć. Hi, hi, hi. To już było *lepsze*. Założę się, że \"przystojniaku\" nie brzmi przy tym tak źle, co?",
      "nm35aacart04761_.mp3": "Uparty jak zawsze. Niech ci będzie. Założę się, że wciąż chcesz mnie o coś bardzo zapytać. Czy to naprawdę takie ważne?",
      "nm35aayuth24015_.mp3": "Darth Malak tam był? Bardzo interesujące, czyż nie, panie?",
      "nm40aabast01052_.mp3": "Ty... chciałeś, żebym cierpiał? Cieszył cię mój ból? Nie.. nie wiem, co powiedzieć. Myślałam, że jest między nami... pewna więź.",
      "nm40aabast01053_.mp3": "Może nie jesteś taki, jak myślałem.",
      "nm40aasaul10139_.mp3": "Nie! Jak mogłeś zdradzić Republikę?",
      "nm40adcart01008_.mp3": "Teraz, kiedy już wiem, kim jesteś naprawdę... Revanie, twoja postawa chyba nie powinna mnie dziwić.",
      "nm40adcart01012_.mp3": "To nie żart. Rada Jedi pojmała Revana i usunęła mu świadomość, a później zaprogramowała mu nową tożsamość. Saul Karath powiedział mi o tym na Lewiatanie, a Bastila to potwierdziła!",
      "nm40adcart01020_.mp3": "Ale... to ty odpowiadasz za śmierć mojej żony i za zniszczenie mojej planety! To ty zniszczyłeś mi życie!",
      "nm40adcart01021_.mp3": "Jak mogłem być takim głupcem! Dlaczego się nie domyśliłem?! Jak mogłeś mnie tak zdradzić?!",
      "nm40adcart01023_.mp3": "Powinieneś był wiedzieć. A ja... *wzdycha* powinienem się był domyślić. Czy... czy wszystko to było kłamstwem? Wszystko, o czym rozmawialiśmy?",
      "nm40adcart01029_.mp3": "To nie żart. Wiesz, o czym mówię. Mówię o tobie, o tym, jak się czułeś...",
      "nm40adcart01037_.mp3": "Ale to prawda. I to okrutna prawda! To... to ty... zabiłeś moją żonę i zniszczyłeś mój świat. To...  to ty zniszczyłeś mi życie!",
      "nm40adcart01039_.mp3": "To nieważne, kto za to odpowiada. Przecież ty to zrobiłeś! Zabiłeś moją żonę... zdradziłeś wszystko, w co wierzyłem! Zniszczyłeś mi życie!",
      "nm40adcart01041_.mp3": "O, to zmienia wszystko! To... to byłeś ty! To ty zaatakowałeś moją planetę! To ty zniszczyłeś mi życie!",
      "nm40adcart01042_.mp3": "Cały czas, kiedy polowaliśmy na Malaka, mieliśmy pod samym nosem jego starego mistrza, który w dodatku słuchał wszystkich tajemnic i poznawał nasze plany!",
      "nm40adcart01051_.mp3": "Nie wiem, czy uda mi się tak łatwo o tym wszystkim zapomnieć, Mission. Po tym wszystkim, co Revan zrobił... jak ktokolwiek z nas mógłby mu wybaczyć?",
      "nm40adcart01052_.mp3": "Jak możesz tak mówić, Mission? Sithowie zbombardowali moją planetę! Revan pozbawił mnie rodziny i zniszczył mi życie!",
      "nm40adcart01096_.mp3": "Chciałbym ci wierzyć. W czasie tej misji wiele razy dowiodłeś, że można na ciebie liczyć, ale tylko na tym mogę się oprzeć.",
      "nm40adcart01098_.mp3": "To musi być jeszcze większym szokiem dla ciebie... Nie wiem, jak udaje ci się zachować zimną krew. Chyba obaj musimy znaleźć jakiś sposób, żeby sobie z tym poradzić.",
      "nm40adcart01106_.mp3": "Możesz na mnie liczyć, o ile nasza misja będzie przebiegać zgodnie z planem. Ale pod żadnym pozorem nie pozwolę, żebyś zdradził Republikę.",
      "nm40adcart01117_.mp3": "I tak zaczynają się kłamstwa. To oczywiste, że coś sobie przypomniałeś, kiedy Malak rzucił ci w twarz całą prawdę. Może to były tylko strzępy wspomnień, ale coś sobie przypomniałeś!",
      "nm40adcart01120_.mp3": "Grozisz mi? Nie zastraszysz mnie - choć nie powinienem się temu dziwić. Zwłaszcza teraz, kiedy wiem, że jesteś... Revanem.",
      "nm41aablac01002_.mp3": "Chwileczkę, zrozumiałeś te stworzenia? Oczywiście... ty i Malak musieliście być tu wcześniej. Nauczyłeś się ich języka, kiedy byłeś Revanem.",

      "nm35aahhkd07274_.mp3": "Wyjaśnienie: Tak jest, mój panie. Zakładałem, że moim poprzednim właścicielem była właśnie korporacja. Tak jednak nie było. Tamten człowiek zakupił mnie na użytek prywatny.",
      "nm35aahhkd07275_.mp3": "Sprawdzanie zakończone: Mój panie, odzyskałem informacje dotyczące osoby, do której należałem, zanim zakupił mnie pracownik korporacji. Intrygujące.",

      "nm35aahhkd07281_.mp3": "Odpowiedź: Wydaje mi się, że nie, mój panie. Potrzebny mu był robot protokolarny i to za jak najniższą cenę. Nie wiem, od kogo mnie kupił.",
      "nm35aahhkd07283_.mp3": "Spostrzeżenie: Na to wygląda, prawda? Do dziś pamiętam mrugające światła Coruscant. Bardzo ładne. Wróćmy tam kiedyś, mój panie.",
      "nm35aahhkd07287_.mp3": "Spostrzeżenie: Senatorzy z reguły nie są mili, mój panie. Albo są tam, gdzie błyskają flesze, albo są we wczorajszych wiadomościach. Mój właściciel bardzo często mi to powtarzał.",
      "nm35aahhkd07291_.mp3": "Odpowiedź: Niestety tak, mój panie. Ale póki żył, byłem bardzo przydatny.",
      "nm35aahhkd07301_.mp3": "Stwierdzenie: Nie mam pojęcia, mój panie. O zdradzie mówimy, jeśli przyłapie się sprawców na gorącym uczynku. Jak nie dadzą się złapać, to tylko przejaw inteligencji, czyż nie?",
      "nm35aahhkd07303_.mp3": "Spostrzeżenie: Jestem *robotem*, mój panie, mam swoje oprogramowanie. Nawet gdyby zabijanie mi się nie podobało, nie miałbym wyboru. Na szczęście uwielbiam tę robotę.",
      "nm35aahhkd07307_.mp3": "Zgodzi się pan ze mną, że jak na wór mięcha, było to dość dziwne zachowanie? Oczywiście wyłączyłem się, gdy tylko dotarło do mnie, że mój właściciel zginął.",
      "nm35aahhkd07309_.mp3": "Spostrzeżenie: Na razie, mój panie. Pamiętaj proszę, że pozostało do odkrycia jeszcze kilka wspomnień.",
      "nm35aahhkd07312_.mp3": "Nie udało mi się dotrzeć do żadnych wcześniejszych wspomnień. Jeśli chce je pan znaleźć, będzie pan musiał we mnie jeszcze pogrzebać.",
      "nm35aahhkd07313_.mp3": "Przy odrobinie szczęścia uda mi się poznać bodziec, który odblokuje mój rdzeń i ta dłubanina przestanie być potrzebna. Niemniej dziękuję ci za dobre chęci, mój panie.",
      "nm35aahhkd07319_.mp3": "Odpowiedź: Mój panie, na Coruscant jest całe *mnóstwo* polityków. Na ich mordowaniu mógłbym spędzić dziesięciolecia i nie byłby to nawet początek.",
      "nm35aahhkd07326_.mp3": "Sprzeciw: To nie fair, mój panie. Choć Bochaba zginął okrutną śmiercią, to ja nie miałem z nią nic wspólnego. No... prawie...",
      "nm35aahhkd07328_.mp3": "Stwierdzenie: Na to wygląda, mój panie. Zgodzi się pan chyba, że to dość odpowiednie zajęcie?",
      "nm35aahhkd07339_.mp3": "Spostrzeżenie: Czy zgodnie z wartościami worów mięcha, które pan wyznaje, mój właściciel nie był bezlitosnym gangsterem i mordercą? Żal mi będzie, gdy ty zginiesz, mój panie.",
      "nm35aahhkd07343_.mp3": "Spostrzeżenie: Zaiste. Może to i lepiej, że mój algorytm zabójcy nie działa... Zgodzi się pan ze mną?",
      "nm35aahhkd07349_.mp3": "Spostrzeżenie: Pasowałoby to do mojego charakteru, mój panie. Ale podoba mi się sposób, w jaki moje losy potoczyły się później, więc nie narzekam.",
      "nm35aahhkd07351_.mp3": "Odpowiedź: Nie, mój panie. Wiem jednak, że nie wszystkie wspomnienia zostały mi przywrócone.",
      "nm35aahhkd07357_.mp3": "Błaganie: Dlaczego, mój panie, czyżbym źle ci służył? Nie mogę kontrolować czynów, które popełniłem... może to dlatego wymazano mi pamięć?",
      "nm35aahhkd07360_.mp3": "Potwierdzenie: HK-47 istnieje tylko po to, by ci służyć, mój panie.",
      "nm35aahhkd07363_.mp3": "Stwierdzenie: A powinienem, mój panie? Nie miałem powodu, by zgładzić te cele, nie ja podjąłem decyzję. Jestem bronią, a nie dłonią, która ją trzyma.",
      "nm35aahhkd07365_.mp3": "Odpowiedź: Zgadza się, mój panie. Bardzo lubię swoją pracę, choć moi poprzedni właściciele wykorzystywali moje zdolności z jeszcze większą radością.",
      "nm35aahhkd07367_.mp3": "Sprawdzanie zakończone: Udało mi się dotrzeć do ostatniego z wymazanych wspomnień, mój panie. Niestety moja historia wciąż nie jest kompletna.",

      "nm35aahhkd07392_.mp3": "Odpowiedź: Jak powiedziałem, mój panie, wiedza ta jest zamknięta w mym rdzeniu. Nie ma sposobu, by się do niej dostać.",
      "nm35aahhkd07394_.mp3": "Spostrzeżenie: Trafiłem do *ciebie*, mój panie. Może to jednak lepiej, że mój algorytm zabójcy już nie działa?",
      "nm35aahhkd07401_.mp3": "Stwierdzenie: Tak się właśnie stało. Nie jestem z tego dumny, mój panie. Muszę jednak powiedzieć, że żołnierz wyglądał na zaskoczonego.",
      "nm35aahhkd07404_.mp3": "Ale poza tym już nic więcej nie mogę ci powiedzieć, mój panie. Przy odrobinie szczęścia szybko odkryjemy bodziec, który odblokuje mój rdzeń.",
      "nm35aahhkd07406_.mp3": "Sprzeciw: To nie fair, mój panie! Czyż praca ze mną nie przynosi ci satysfakcji?",

      "nm35aajuha11116_.mp3": "Wiem, że za bardzo się tym wszystkim przejmuję i że moje słowa pewnie cię oburzą, ale uważaj, byś nie uległ Ciemnej Stronie tak łatwo jak ja. Masz w sobie ogromny potencjał - nie zmarnuj go.",
      "nm35aajuha11144_.mp3": "Ale... tak było lepiej. Cieszę się, że mi w tym pomogłeś.",
      "nm35aajuha11162_.mp3": "Kiedy się spotkaliśmy, to ty mnie przekonałeś, żebym odwróciła się od Ciemnej Strony. Ale teraz wygląda na to, że sam zmierzasz w kierunku tej samej pułapki, z której mnie uratowałeś.",
      "nm35aajuha11165_.mp3": "Kiedy się pierwszy raz spotkaliśmy, to ja patrzyłam na ciebie z pogardą. Byłeś dla mnie tylko robakiem, którego Rada Jedi wysłała, żeby się mnie pozbyć.",
      "nm35aajuha11166_.mp3": "Ale byłeś wtedy potężniejszy, niż się spodziewałam. Wyglądało na to, że pokonanie mnie nie sprawiło ci najmniejszego kłopotu.",
      "nm35aajuha11169_.mp3": "Obserwuję cię i widzę, że coraz bardziej odchodzisz od reguł Kodeksu Jedi. Zastanawia mnie, czy ty też to zauważyłeś.",
      "nm35aajuha11171_.mp3": "I to zrobiłeś. Usunąłeś mroczną skazę, która mnie pożerała, i przywróciłeś mnie Jasnej Stronie. To dzięki tobie się stamtąd wyrwałam.",
      "nm35aajuha11187_.mp3": "Od jakiegoś czasu uważnie cię obserwuję. Ciekawe czy to zauważyłeś.",

      "nm35aajuha11271_.mp3": "Gdyby nie ty i Bastila, Sithowie nie mieliby powodu, żeby zniszczyć Taris! To twoja wina, że tam byłeś i że uratowałeś Bastilę!",
      "nm35aajuha11279_.mp3": "Naprawdę ciężko stracić całą swoją przeszłość. Ale skąd ty mógłbyś o tym wiedzieć?",
      "nm35aajuha11287_.mp3": "...Pewnie nie miałeś innego wyjścia... zrobiłeś to, co niezbędne. Republika potrzebuje ciebie i Bastili. Może nawet bardziej niż była jej potrzebna Taris.",
      "nm35aajuha11297_.mp3": "Ale poświęcenie całej planety to zbyt wielka ofiara! Jak byś się czuł, gdyby to Dantooine, Alderaan czy jakaś inna planeta zostały tak po prostu unicestwione?",
      "nm35aajuha11298_.mp3": "Czy wtedy też byłbyś tak bezduszny?",
      "nm35aajuha11326_.mp3": "Wiesz... Kiedy się lepiej przyjrzę, wydaje mi się, że jesteś nawet do niej troszkę podobny...",
      "nm35aajuha11404_.mp3": "Manaan to planeta obfitująca w wodę... co pewnie już sam zauważyłeś.",
      "nm35aajuha11432_.mp3": "To dziwne, że Revan tu przybył, ale kto wie - może w gęstwinie konarów któregoś z tych drzew znajdziemy kolejny element Gwiezdnej Mapy.",
      "nm35aajuha11447_.mp3": "Był w takiej samej sytuacji jak ja, kiedy znalazłeś mnie w gaju. Żal mi go.",
      "nm35aajuha11472_.mp3": "Kiedy tylko nadarzyła się okazja, opuściłam moją planetę i zaczęłam ich szukać. Znalazłam ich i zostałam przez nich przyjęta. Później spędziłam na Dantooine kilka lat, realizując swoje marzenia. I wtedy zjawiłeś się ty.",
      "nm35aajuha11514_.mp3": "Dziękuję za wsparcie. Nie powinnam się była tak unosić, ale ty przyjąłeś to ze spokojem. Jesteś o wiele lepszym Jedi niż ja.",
      "nm35aajuha11588_.mp3": "Głównym powodem był charyzmatyczny przywódca Jedi. To jego oddziały mnie uwolniły i zainspirowały do tego, by wstąpić do Zakonu Jedi.",
      "nm35aajuha11590_.mp3": "Był dla mnie idolem. Rozkoszowałam się wszystkimi opowieściami o jego czynach. Był spełnieniem moich marzeń o Jedi. I wciąż twierdzę, że wtedy się nie myliłam.",
      "nm35aajuha11593_.mp3": "Dowódcą tych, którzy przybyli walczyć z Mandalorianami, był młody, ale potężny Jedi... nazywał się Revan.",
      "nm35aajuha11595_.mp3": "Tak, to byłeś ty. Nigdy cię nie widziałam - inaczej bym cię rozpoznała. Ale to właśnie twoja armia uwolniła mnie z rąk handlarzy niewolników.",
      "nm35aajuha11596_.mp3": "Nie potrafię nawet wyrazić tego, jak wielki miałeś wpływ na moje życie... i jak wiele dla mnie znaczysz.",
      "nm35aajuha11598_.mp3": "Nie potrafię nawet wyrazić tego, jak wielki miałeś wpływ na moje życie.",
      "nm35aajuha11599_.mp3": "Tak, ten Revan. Jedi, którzy uległ Ciemnej Stronie, stał się Mrocznym Lordem Sithów, a później został pokonany przez Bastilę i jej oddział.",
      "nm35aajuha11600_.mp3": "Nie wiem, co takiego zaszło w czasie Wojen Mandaloriańskich, że Revan i Malak ulegli Ciemnej Stronie, ani dlaczego tak im zależało na Gwiezdnych Mapach, ale ten Jedi, którego ja znałam, był przykładnym członkiem Zakonu.",
      "nm35aajuha11601_.mp3": "Wybacz, jeśli się z tym nie zgadzasz, ale żeby to zrozumieć, musisz zdać sobie sprawę, że Revan był naprawdę wspaniałym Jedi. Cokolwiek sprawiło, że uległ Ciemnej Stronie, naprawdę musi być przerażające.",
      "nm35aajuha11604_.mp3": "To pewnie tylko bezsensowne spekulacje. Chciałam tylko, żebyś wiedział o tym, czego wcześniej ci nie mówiłam.",
      "nm35aajuha11605_.mp3": "Ale nie obawiaj się, wciąż możesz na mnie liczyć, nawet jeśli naszym wrogiem jest Malak, uczeń Revana, a nawet gdyby to był sam Revan.",
      "nm35aajuha11611_.mp3": "Tak... Domyślałam się, że zareagujesz gniewem... Ale to był Revan.",
      "nm35aajuha11617_.mp3": "Jeśli nie będziesz chciał słuchać, to zrozumiem. Ale najpierw mnie wysłuchaj.",
      "nm35aajuha11643_.mp3": "Oboje wiemy, co było potem.",
      "nm35aajuha11645_.mp3": "Jestem ci wdzięczna, że dałeś mi szansę na spełnienie marzeń i uchroniłeś przed staniem się tym, czego zawsze nienawidziłam.",
      "nm35aajuha11683_.mp3": "Źle mnie zrozumiałeś.",
      "nm35aajuha11684_.mp3": "Podróżujemy ze sobą od Dantooine, a ja wciąż nic o tobie nie wiem. Mógłbyś... mógłbyś mi zrobić przyjemność i  coś mi o sobie opowiedzieć?",
      "nm35aajuha11690_.mp3": "Cieszę się, że znalazłeś czas, by ze mną porozmawiać. W jaki sposób znalazłeś się na Dantooine?",
      "nm35aajuha11694_.mp3": "Wybacz... Przeszkodziłam ci. Wiem już o twoich dokonaniach - o tym, jak pokonałeś Mandalorian... i jak uległeś Ciemnej Stronie.",
      "nm35aajuha11697_.mp3": "Wybacz... Przeszkodziłam ci. Co robiłeś, zanim znalazłeś się na Ta... przedtem?",
      "nm35aajuha11725_.mp3": "Myślałam ostatnio o naszej wyprawie. Jestem wdzięczna i zaszczycona tym, że mnie na nią zabrałeś.",
      "nm35aajuha11726_.mp3": "To zaszczyt ci towarzyszyć i widzieć, jak udaje ci się odkupić swoje winy z  czasów, kiedy byłeś pod wpływem Ciemnej Strony.",
      "nm35aajuha11734_.mp3": "Nawet jeśli nieczęsto ze sobą rozmawiamy albo jesteśmy rozdzieleni, to wciąż czuję się częścią naszej grupy. Tej samej, którą wybrałeś, by towarzyszyła tobie i Bastili w czasie tej misji.",
      "nm35aajuha11745_.mp3": "Chciałam ci tylko... podziękować, że mnie zaakceptowałeś.",
      "nm35aajuha11771_.mp3": "Nie wiem... Zbyt długo to w sobie dusiłam. Myślałam, że ty mnie zrozumiesz. Nie jesteś taki jak inni. Jest w tobie coś... innego.",
      "nm35aajuha11774_.mp3": "Dziękuję. Jesteś milszy, niż się spodziewałam... Wytrzymujesz ze mną, a ja cię tak wykorzystuję.",
      "nm35aajuha11781_.mp3": "Jak możesz tak mówić? Widziałeś Taris i wiesz, jakie kanalie mieszkają w tej zapadłej dziurze.",
      "nm35aajuha11784_.mp3": "Co? Ty... Jesteś taki sam jak oni!",
      "nm35aajuha11785_.mp3": "Nie sądziłam, że możesz być tak okrutny.",
      "nm35aajuha11820_.mp3": "Gdyby... gdyby tak się rzeczywiście stało i zagroziłabym naszej misji, powinieneś mnie zabić.",
      "nm35aajuha11824_.mp3": "Gdyby do tego doszło, chcę, żeby zrobił to ten, który wcześniej uratował mnie od Ciemnej Strony.",
      "nm35aajuha11831_.mp3": "Nie jestem tchórzem! Nikogo i niczego się nie boję! Ale ty nie musiałeś uciekać, kiedy wróg niszczył twoją planetę.",

      "nm40adcart01054_.mp3": "Wyczuwałam w tobie obecność Ciemnej Strony, Revanie - tak jak w każdym z nas. Znam zagrożenia tej ścieżki, ale wiem też, że ten, kto raz upadnie, może się też nawrócić.",
      "nm40adcart01111_.mp3": "W twoich czynach widziałem oznaki Ciemnej Strony, ale nie opuszczę cię, tak jak ty nie zawiodłeś mnie w potrzebie. Zostanę przy tobie, Revanie.",
      "nm40adcart01112_.mp3": "Wyczuwam w tobie konflikt między Jasną a Ciemną Stroną. Nie wiem, jak to się skończy, ale nie opuszczę cię w tej trudnej chwili, tak jak ty kiedyś mnie nie opuściłeś.",

      "nm45aadart04037_.mp3": "Rozejrzyj się, Revanie. Czy widzisz te ciała? Spójrz na ich twarze, powinieneś je pamiętać z akademii. Są to zwłoki Jedi, którzy polegli podczas ataku na Dantooine. Wszyscy są martwi, ale coś ich wyróżnia:",

      "nm45aadart04047_.mp3": "Jesteś potężniejszy niż Bastila i jej Bitewna medytacja. Mógłbym to wykorzystać, gdyby udało mi się nad tobą zapanować. Ale czy warto ryzykować?",

      "nm45aadart04056_.mp3": "Kiedyś byłeś ode mnie potężniejszy, Revanie. Ale jako twój uczeń prześcignąłem cię. Mistrz musi być zawsze silniejszy od ucznia... dlatego właśnie cię zdradziłem.",

      "nm33aayuth21009_.mp3": "Przecież już dałam ci odpowiedź, człowieku. Nie zawracaj mi głowy albo się zdenerwuję.",
      "nm33aayuth21011_.mp3": "Czyli ktoś cię przyjął, mimo że ja ci odmówiłam? Masz szczęście człowieku, gdyż jestem w wielkodusznym nastroju.",
      "nm33aayuth21014_.mp3": "Nie widzisz, że jestem zajęta, człowieku? Ach, widzę, że masz medalion. Gdzie go zdobyłeś?",
      "nm33aayuth21016_.mp3": "Aha. Wykazałeś się inicjatywą, choć normalnie nie tak dobieramy uczniów do akademii.",
      "nm33aayuth21018_.mp3": "[Sukces] Tak? Z pewnością od kogoś z pozostałych. Rzeczywiście pasujesz na kandydata do akademii, choć jest w tobie... coś dziwnego...",

      "nm33aayuth21021_.mp3": "[Porażka] Myślałeś, że uda ci się mnie okłamać? Pewnie ukradłeś medalion i zabiłeś jego właściciela. Muszę przyznać, wykazałeś się inicjatywą.",
      "nm33aayuth21022_.mp3": "My, Sithowie, popieramy niezależne myślenie. Może nawet będziesz odpowiednim kandydatem. Bo przypuszczam, że tego właśnie pragniesz? Zostać Sithem?",
      "nm33aayuth21024_.mp3": "Nie bądź bezczelny, człowieku. Zadałam ci pytanie i nie dam się zbyć. Jeszcze raz... skąd masz ten medalion?",
      "nm33aayuth21029_.mp3": "Nie jesteś pierwszym Jedi, który przybył tu, chcąc porzucić ten wasz rozpadający się Zakon.",
      "nm33aayuth21030_.mp3": "Czy potrzebujesz czegoś, człowieku? Mam nadzieję, że to coś ważnego, bo nie należę do cierpliwych osób.",
      "nm33aayuth21032_.mp3": "Kim jestem? Pewnie od niedawna jesteś na Korriban. Albo to, albo dotąd chodziłeś po omacku.",
      "nm33aayuth21034_.mp3": "To ja decyduję, kto z przybyłych kandydatów zostanie Sithem. A dlaczego pytasz? Chcesz wstąpić do akademii? Czy po to tu przybyłeś?",
      "nm33aayuth21037_.mp3": "My posiadamy największą moc, mój przyjacielu. Być Sithem to znaczy smakować wolności i zaznać zwycięstwa. Nic nie jest tak wspaniałe, jak możliwość zmuszania Mocy do posłuszeństwa.",
      "nm33aayuth21042_.mp3": "Usłyszałeś już wystarczająco wiele, co? *chichocze* A więc co będzie? Przybyłeś tu, by zostać Sithem czy nie?",
      "nm33aayuth21046_.mp3": "Tak? Tego jeszcze nie było. Rób, jak chcesz, człowieku. Ja cię nie powstrzymam.",
      "nm33aayuth21062_.mp3": "To nasza filozofia, dobór naturalny -  przetrwa najsilniejszy. Musisz zawsze mieć się na baczności, zawsze być gotów zabić, gdy tylko nadarzy się ku temu okazja. My to propagujemy, gdyż dzięki temu Sithowie rosną w siłę.",
      "nm33aayuth21068_.mp3": "A co z Revanem? Revan nie żyje. Może i potrafisz posługiwać się Mocą, ale nie potrafisz kłamać.",
      "nm33aayuth21075_.mp3": "To oczywiste, że jesteś Jedi. W dodatku Moc jest w tobie bardzo silna. Długo należałeś do Zakonu? Czy szkolili cię?",
      "nm33aayuth21076_.mp3": "Wyczuwam, że Moc jest w tobie silna. Że już doprowadziłeś niektóre ze swoich zdolności do perfekcji. Szkolenie Jedi, czyż nie?",
      "nm33aayuth21081_.mp3": "Tak myślałam. To ciekawe, że wypuścili z garści kogoś o takiej Mocy. Czy może przybyłeś tu szpiegować? Dla dobra.",
      "nm33aayuth21086_.mp3": "Z taką Mocą mógłbyś zostać wielkim Sithem. Może... jeśli ci pozwolę. Czy to cię interesuje?",
      "nm33aayuth21091_.mp3": "Hm... Zaiste, dziwna to odpowiedź. Czy twój umysł jest jakoś nieprzystosowany? Będzie z ciebie bardzo interesujący uczeń.",
      "nm33aayuth21092_.mp3": "Z taką Mocą mógłbyś zostać wielkim Sithem. Może... jeśli ci pozwolę. Czy to cię interesuje?",
      "nm33aayuth21094_.mp3": "Jaka szkoda. A już dostałeś nawet medalion i takie tam.",
      "nm33aayuth21096_.mp3": "Cóż, człowieku... Jeśli zmienisz kiedyś zdanie, wiesz, gdzie mnie znaleźć.",
      "nm33aayuth21098_.mp3": "[Porażka] *chichocze* Musisz mieć niewielkie mniemanie o mistrzach Sithów, by próbować tej sztuczki. Jednak nie będę miała ci tego za złe... okazałeś inicjatywę.",
      "nm33aayuth21104_.mp3": "Zaprowadzę cię do akademii, a tam zobaczymy, czy jesteś gotowy, by wstąpić w szeregi Sithów.",
      "nm33aayuth21109_.mp3": "Nieważne. Tylko dopilnuj, żeby nie przeszkadzali ci w treningu i nie sprawiali kłopotów. Jesteś za nich odpowiedzialny. A teraz... czy jesteś już gotów, by udać się do akademii?",
      "nm33aayuth21112_.mp3": "Rozumiem. Dobrze, tak długo, jak nie będą ci przeszkadzać w treningu i nie będą sprawiali kłopotów. A teraz... czy jesteś już gotów, by udać się do akademii?",
      "nm33aayuth21113_.mp3": "Czy jesteś już gotów, by tam się udać?",
      "nm33aayuth21115_.mp3": "Nie, przyjacielu... To nie ja wprowadzę cię do akademii. Może jeśli któryś z Sithów cię zaakceptuje i da ci medalion.",
      "nm33aayuth21120_.mp3": "Twoje słowa są dziwne... a co jeszcze bardziej dziwne, nie wyczuwam w tobie oszustwa. Jesteś intrygującą zagadką, człowieku, zagadką o wielkiej mocy.",
      "nm35aautha22007_.mp3": "Jak się zdaje, ten człowiek przeszedł już jakieś szkolenie, mistrzu Utharze. Bardzo obiecujący, moim zdaniem.",
      "nm35aayuth24001_.mp3": "Ach, to ty... mój ulubiony obiecujący.",
      "nm35aayuth24003_.mp3": "Absolutnie. Jak dla mnie, to ty masz największe szanse zdobyć dość uznania, by zostać przyjętym do grona Sithów.",
      "nm35aayuth24004_.mp3": "W rzeczy samej, jestem tego tak pewna, że chcę ci dać szansę z gatunku niepowtarzalnych. Jesteś zainteresowany?",
      "nm35aayuth24018_.mp3": "Czujesz się zniechęcony? Przecież nie proszę cię, żebyś to zrobił w pojedynkę albo bez żadnych korzyści dla siebie.",
      "nm35aayuth24019_.mp3": "Mistrz Uthar musi ulec nam obojgu naraz. I tylko to jest tu ważne. To bardzo prosta sprawa.",
      "nm35aayuth24024_.mp3": "A więc przygotuję wszystko na twój końcowy test. Twoim jedynym zadaniem jest zostać do niego wybranym... nie zawiedź mnie.",
      "nm35aayuth24026_.mp3": "Już jesteś w to zaangażowany. Nie bądź idiotą.",
      "nm35aayuth24039_.mp3": "Nie za bardzo. Och, nie martw się... mój plan przyniesie korzyść nam obojgu, tego możesz być pewien.",
      "nm35aayuth24042_.mp3": "Co ty tu jeszcze robisz? Idź zaraz do Uthara i powiedz mu, że jesteś gotowy przystąpić do końcowego testu! Okazja nie czeka, idź!",
      "nm35aayuth24054_.mp3": "Słyszałam, że zabiłeś Mekela? Cóż... co to w sumie za różnica. Ludzi tak podstępnych i tak się trzeba szybko pozbywać.",
      "nm35aayuth24056_.mp3": "Dobrze sobie radzisz... Podobno już prawie zdobyłeś dość uznania, by wygrać. Wiedziałam, że to tobie się uda.",
      "nm35aayuth24057_.mp3": "Słyszałam, że zdobyłeś jeszcze więcej uznania. Zbliżasz się do zwycięstwa... to dobrze.",
      "nm35aayuth24066_.mp3": "Ach. Sprytne. Normalnie zmierzyłbyś się z jakimś innym uczniem, pewnie jednym z tych, którym się nie powiodło.",
      "nm35aayuth24067_.mp3": "Najwyraźniej Uthar postanowił się mnie pozbyć. Ale dlaczego...? Coś mu powiedziałeś?",
      "nm35aayuth24069_.mp3": "Co?! Ty idioto! Pewnie, to godne podziwu starać się wykiwać obie strony, ale igrasz z ogniem.",
      "nm35aayuth24075_.mp3": "Zobaczmy. Hm... a więc to prawda. Dziękuję, że mi to przyniosłeś... teraz będę znacznie silniejsza, niż Uthar będzie się spodziewał.",
      "nm35aayuth24077_.mp3": "Ha! Głupiec. Teraz będę mogła odeprzeć każdą truciznę. Dziękuję, że mi o tym powiedziałeś... będę silniejsza, niż Uthar będzie się spodziewał.",
      "nm35aayuth24088_.mp3": "Musisz zaimponować mistrzowi Utharowi... poinformuj go, czego dokonałeś, albo zanieś mu jakieś przedmioty, które znalazłeś.",
      "nm35aayuth24102_.mp3": "Może powinieneś porozmawiać z innymi kandydatami i znaleźć takiego, który da ci zyskać przewagę.",
      "nm35aayuth24103_.mp3": "Myślę, że Lashowe byłaby tu idealna. Jest zbyt ufna, z pewnością dałbyś radę przekonać ją, aby ci jakoś \"pomogła\".",
      "nm35aayuth24104_.mp3": "Tylko uważaj, żebyś to ty na tym skorzystał, a nie ona. Bądź bezwzględny, jeśli potrzeba. To jedyna rzecz, jaka naprawdę zaimponuje Utharowi.",
      "nm35aayuth24105_.mp3": "Nadal uważam, że najlepiej byś zrobił, biorąc Lashowe do pomocy. On a jest o wiele za ufna i na pewno dałaby się przekonać do pomagania ci.",
      "nm35aayuth24106_.mp3": "Jeszcze inny pomysł to udać się do Doliny Mrocznych Lordów, na powierzchni. Jest tam wiele starożytnych ruin, które mógłbyś zbadać.",
      "nm35aayuth24114_.mp3": "Jedi kazaliby ci wierzyć, że spokój jest pożądanym celem. Że mistrzostwo Mocy osiąga się poprzez spokój ducha, że brak konfliktów czyni cię lepszym.",
      "nm35aayuth24130_.mp3": "Im silniejszy jesteś Mocą, tym większa twoja potęga. Jednak trzeba nieustannie walczyć o swoją potęgę.",
      "nm35aayuth24131_.mp3": "Bez walki zwycięstwo nie ma znaczenia. Bez walki nie staniesz się lepszy. Bez walki jest tylko stagnacja.",
      "nm35aayuth24161_.mp3": "Revan? Masz na myśli byłego mistrza Dartha Malaka?",
      "nm35aayuth24169_.mp3": "Być może tak samo jest z Revanem. Być może nadal gdzieś sobie żyje, wyczekując zemsty na Malaku.",
      "nm35aayuth24172_.mp3": "A jak bym miała? Nie dość, że go nie znałam, to jeszcze Revan słynął z noszenia pełnego hełmu i płaszcza.",
      "nm35aayuth24173_.mp3": "Być może potęga Mocy zniekształciła ciało Revana... to się zdarza. W każdym razie, nie wydaje mi się, żebym jeszcze miała go kiedyś spotkać.",
      "nm35aayuth24221_.mp3": "Dziękuję. Szkoda, że nie jestem tak silna Mocą jak ty. Wiele mógłbyś zmienić, gdybyś chciał.",
      "nm35aayuth24232_.mp3": "Wracaj szybko... przyjacielu.",
      "nm35aayuth24234_.mp3": "Świetnie zacząłeś... idź więc, zdobądź więcej uznania!",
      "nm36aaends08000_.mp3": "Hej, ty! Jakim sposobem wychodzisz z grobowca Nagi Sadowa w pojedynkę? Poszedłeś tam na końcowy test, nie? Gdzie jest mistrz Uthar?",
      "nm36aaends08014_.mp3": "[Porażka] Kłamiesz! Nigdy byś nie dał rady zabić mistrza!!",
      "nm36aaends08016_.mp3": "Nie jesteś Revanem! Szybko, atakować zdrajcę!!",
      "nm36aaends08024_.mp3": "Ale już masz kłopoty! Jeżeli zrobiłeś coś mistrzowi Utharowi, to srogo za to zapłacisz!",
      "nm36aalash02006_.mp3": "To ty mnie namówiłeś na ten plan. Dlaczego nie miałabym go doprowadzić do końca?",
      "nm36aalash02008_.mp3": "Zapomnij. Nie ma żadnej gwarancji. Pomogłeś mi, a teraz ja pomogę tobie. Chyba że mi nie ufasz?",
      "nm36aalash02018_.mp3": "Nie dostaniesz go. To był mój pomysł! Umawialiśmy się, że to ja go zaniosę, nie ty!",
      "nm39aautha03083_.mp3": "Ty głupcze! Nie masz pojęcia, co zrobiłeś!",
      "nm39aautha03087_.mp3": "Ty... zdradziłeś mnie?! Myślałam... że jesteśmy przyjaciółmi! Niech cię cholera!",

      "nm39aayuth04001_.mp3": "Jesteś... dla mnie zbyt silny. Myliłam się, myśląc inaczej. Jestem... zdana na twoją łaskę.",
      "nm39aayuth04005_.mp3": "Tak.... chyba tak. Coś mi mówi, że ty... nie jesteś taki, jak inni uczniowie. Nie wiem, dlaczego.",
      "nm39aayuth04013_.mp3": "Nie miałam wyboru. Ty... przypominałeś mi o czasach, zanim zostałam Sithem. Ja... nie chciałam o tym myśleć.",
      "nm39aayuth04020_.mp3": "Nie wiem, czy kiedykolwiek będę mogła do nich wrócić... ale nie tu jest moje miejsce. Dziękuję... dziękuję, że mi to uprzytomniłeś.",
      "nm39aayuth04021_.mp3": "Czeka na ciebie twoje przeznaczenie, przyjacielu, i życzę ci powodzenia w wypełnianiu go. Niech Moc... będzie z tobą.",
      "nm39aayuth04022_.mp3": "Jesteś zbyt silny. Nie pozostałbyś długo w moim cieniu... o ile akademia cię kiedykolwiek w ogóle interesowała.",
      "nm39aayuth04027_.mp3": "Dobrze. Ja... nie będę się starała cię powstrzymać i nie powiem nikomu, co tu zrobiłeś.",
      "nm39aayuth04038_.mp3": "I to właśnie czyni cię innym. Większość Sithów... nawet by się nad tym nie zastanawiała.",
      "nm39aayuth04040_.mp3": "Rozumiem. Powinnam była wiedzieć... od samego początku. Ale nie jesteś już tym Mrocznym Lordem, którym kiedyś byłeś, czyż nie?",
      "nm39aayuth04042_.mp3": "Jesteś... dla mnie zbyt silny. Ulegnij nienawiści i skończ ze mną... jeśli tego chcesz.",
      "nm39aayuth04049_.mp3": "W takim razie mam nadzieję, że zdobyłeś już to, po co przybyłeś do akademii, cokolwiek to było.",
      "nm39aayuth04051_.mp3": "Litość? A więc naprawdę nie tu twoje miejsce. Mam nadzieję, że zdobyłeś to, po co przybyłeś do akademii.",
      "nm39aayuth04058_.mp3": "...uch! Ten ból! Ja... dlaczego mi to zrobiłeś? Myślałam...",
      "nm39aayuth04060_.mp3": "Nie-niech cię cholera! Ja... ja cię za to zniszczę! Ty.. ty nigdy nie odejdziesz stąd żywy!!",
      "nm39aayuth04066_.mp3": "Nie-niech cię cholera! Nigdy już nie zostaniesz Sithem! Ja... ja cię za to zniszczę! Nigdy... nigdy się nie wydostaniesz żywy!!",
      "nm39aayuth04078_.mp3": "A więc nie powinieneś mieć trudności z bronieniem się. Choć to niewiele pomoże."
