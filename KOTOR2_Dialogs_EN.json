      "gblkreia620.mp3": "Very well. Of which did you wish instruction?",
      "gblkreia627.mp3": "Helpful, especially in tandem with other force techniques. This one opens you to the Force, allowing you to recover your strength with the Force rapidly in combat.",
      "gblkreia626.mp3": "With this form, your use of the Force will have more damaging effects, but it will drain you as well. Effective, but only if conventional means are having no effect.",
      "gblkreia623.mp3": "It is a great technique that you have learned. ",
      "gblkreia624.mp3": "Gifted only to the highest of Jedi masters - and the Sith - this technique makes your Force powers more difficult to resist... and they will last longer as well.",
      "gblkreia625.mp3": "But it can tire you quickly. Use it only in short combats, where expediency is necessary.",
      "gblkreia621.mp3": "It allows you to recover your strength with the Force more quickly, and it lends strength to your Force powers.",
      "gblkreia622.mp3": "It has no other drawbacks - such a form is a gift, preferred of the Jedi Consulars, and effective in combats where you must fight only through the Force. ",
      "gblkreia589.mp3": "The Jedi practice many forms, many styles of lightsaber combat. It is good to know them, but not to rely on them.",
      "gblkreia590.mp3": "You may have already have felt the Shii-Cho, the simplest of the forms return to you as your skill and perceptions have returned.",
      "gblkreia591.mp3": "Others may come with time, with experience.",
      "gblkreia603.mp3": "Perhaps one of the greatest styles, learned only by the most skilled of Force wielders. Impressive.",
      "gblkreia604.mp3": "In many ways, some have described it as a surrender to the Force and to chaos, to strike at an opponent with such speed and angles of attack that they have difficulty countering it.",
      "gblkreia605.mp3": "Your number of attacks will increase, and you will notice many more of them shall slip beneath an opponent's guard - critically wounding them.",
      "gblkreia606.mp3": "But in surrendering yourself to the Force in such a way reduces your ability to resist its effects should the enemy turn the Force against you. Be on your guard. ",
      "gblkreia601.mp3": "A blending of younger forms, and all of them in moderation. In the blending, much of the individuality is lost, but the strengths are spread evenly, and there is little weakness in it.",
      "gblkreia602.mp3": "Its great strength is the way it allows the Force to flow through you, revitalizing one even in the middle of combat.",
      "gblkreia600.mp3": "An aggressive technique - but it is powerful, effective. It can counter blaster weapons, and add to the damage of your critical.",
      "gblkreia598.mp3": "Ah, one of the techniques you have learned from the masters.",
      "gblkreia599.mp3": "This technique is good against a lone opponent, and you will find your critical strikes are more effective. But you will be vulnerable to almost everyone else you are fighting.",
      "gblkreia596.mp3": "{Slightly disapproving}A... defensive technique. But effective. Use it if you do not wish to be hit, or if you are facing many opponents with blasters.",
      "gblkreia597.mp3": "With a lightsaber blade and enough skill in deflection, it is an excellent offense against blasters, but in other situations, it merely delays the inevitable.",
      "gblkreia594.mp3": "Ah - a technique that helps one resist the Force attacks of an enemy - and also is excellent in lightsaber combat.",
      "gblkreia595.mp3": "It does more damage, but it leaves you vulnerable to other attacks. Use it against others wielding the Force or lightsabers... but not against anyone else.",
      "gblkreia592.mp3": "It is simple, and its simplicity is strength. It allows focus, a slightly improved chance of connecting with one's opponent.",
      "gblkreia593.mp3": "It has no other advantages or disadvantages - it is an effective form to fall back on when no other form will do.",
      "gblkreia982.mp3": "{Slightly contemptuous and judgmental, thinks a lightsaber is a crutch}Indeed? A Jedi tool - and a Sith weapon. And why do you need such a thing?  ",
      "gblkreia983.mp3": "{Stern, slight disgust}Then listen to me. There is much weight, much craving attached to such a tiny thing of light. ",
      "gblkreia985.mp3": "A lightsaber - any weapon - only achieves worth in how it is wielded - in the effort, the struggle of one who holds it.",
      "gblkreia986.mp3": "Such a weapon does not make a Jedi or a Sith. And at times it makes much them much, much less than they are. ",
      "gblkreia988.mp3": "I suspect that you will learn the parts and the path to build it in time - but until then, focus on rebuilding yourself. ",

      "gblkreia488.mp3": "What you heard was the echo of the past. And it travels still. ",
      "gblkreia493.mp3": "Of course. That is the nature of echoes. And when there is a wound in the Force, it rarely leaves the life around it untouched. ",
      "gblkreia492.mp3": "Of course you do not. It is the past, the sound no one wishes to hear within them.",
      "gblkreia489.mp3": "The answer will come to you in time. {Beat}It must. ",
      "gblkreia490.mp3": "{Quiet, speaking of her own death}When there is nothing more that you may learn from me, when the ruins of your past have been cleared away and I am no more, then you shall know what it is.",

      "gblkreia427.mp3": "There are many secrets that the Force may not unlock, for they are not things of life... to uncover such secrets can allow you to see events more clearly. ",
      "gblkreia428.mp3": "It can grant you more weapons, more wealth, and allow you access to places and their secrets that can often turn the tide of a battle or change events. ",
      "gblkreia429.mp3": "Within this vessel is a sealed container that puzzles me. Use your skills upon it and see what it contains. ",
      "gblkreia424.mp3": "{Pleased, likes this training}The ability to persuade others is a powerful weapon... perhaps more so than any lightsaber.",
      "gblkreia425.mp3": "It is a strength to defeat an opponent without combat, to convince them that your will is right, or just... or will simply benefit them in a way that they had not perceived.",
      "gblkreia426.mp3": "Examine their actions, and the why of how they do them. And when you achieve such understanding, more truths may be revealed.",
      "gblkreia421.mp3": "Very well. Then know this... how some situations play out depend on who is perceiving them... and whether they are being perceived. ",
      "gblkreia422.mp3": "Your ability to control the perception of others in such situations will allow you to manipulate events, to resolve them peacefully or violently.",

      "gblatton176.mp3": "That's just a name - it's what we did that was important. ",
      "gblatton164.mp3": "I did. Up until the Republic officers began to \"betray\" their oaths to the Republic and side with Revan - Admiral Karath, Mon Halan, General Derred, and all the rest.",
      "gblatton165.mp3": "Right after that final battle at Malachor, I was right there with the rest of the defectors, because it was the right thing to do.",
      "gblatton166.mp3": "No, it wasn't. We needed the Jedi during the Mandalorian Wars, more than anything. ",
      "gblatton167.mp3": "The Mandalorians were slaughtering us by the millions. The millions.",

      "gblatton175.mp3": "Well, that puts us on the same level, doesn't it? Doesn't make your decision any more right than mine if you want to start sentencing me.",
      "gblatton171.mp3": "If that's what you want to call knowing when to fight and when to kill, then yes, but you can't really break down people into Sith and Jedi and expect everything to make sense. ",

      "gblatton172.mp3": "We were loyal to Revan. That was enough. He saved us. ",
      "gblatton161.mp3": "Because I followed orders. ",
      "gblatton162.mp3": "But it was more than that - you were there, you knew how easy it was to hate the Jedi who sat back in the Republic \"evaluating\" the threat... and watched us die against the Mandalorians. ",
      "gblatton163.mp3": "Because you can't believe in the Republic anymore after the Mandalorian Wars. After Revan, nothing was the same.",

      "gblatton029.mp3": "Yeah? That's a surprise. Did he say I owed him credits, too?",
      "gblatton031.mp3": "{Challenging}No, because you're asking about it - if I wanted to tell you anything, I would have come and told you. Anything else?",

      "gblatton037.mp3": "You know what? Not once have I asked you about the Mandalorian Wars. Not once.",
      "gblatton038.mp3": "I heard about Dxun. Everyone has. I heard about {SAIR-A-CO}Serroco, and I sure as hell know about Malachor V. ",
      "gblatton039.mp3": "What makes you think you've got the right to interrogate me on anything? You've got plenty of lives to answer for - all you Jedi do. ",
      "gblatton040.mp3": "{Challenging}How did you even live with yourself after Malachor? Is that why you went back to the Jedi Council? Hoping they'd kill you?",
      "gblatton041.mp3": "Wasn't it? Maybe you thought they'd forgive you - sure, you might have thought they'd execute you.",
      "gblatton042.mp3": "But Jedi don't kill do they? At least not their prisoners. Maybe you were counting on it when you went back in chains. ",
      "gblatton043.mp3": "So you got off easy - you were exiled, brushed under the cargo ramp, another dirty little Jedi secret. ",
      "gblatton044.mp3": "{Quiet, deadly}I'll tell you - all those Jedi at Malachor? They deserved it. Every last one of them. ",
      "gblatton050.mp3": "Go ahead and try. I might be a little more than you can handle... but I expect that kind of arrogance from a Jedi.",
      "gblatton051.mp3": "Whatever - just leave me alone. I don't know why I'm wasting time with you anyway.",
      "gblatton052.mp3": "Oh yeah? Shows how much you know. Maybe you're wrong about a lot of other things, too. ",
      "gblatton045.mp3": "Because Jedi lie. And they manipulate. And every act of charity or kindness they do, you can drag it out squirming into the light and see it for what it is. ",
      "gblatton046.mp3": "The galaxy doesn't need Jedi arrogance or Jedi hypocrisy anymore.",
      "gblatton048.mp3": "At least the Sith are honest about what they're killing for. The Jedi are pacifists... except in times of war. They're teachers... except when it comes to telling their students the truth. ",
      "gblatton049.mp3": "And when they save you, it's only so you can suffer more. ",
      "gblatton047.mp3": "The Jedi... the Sith... you don't get it, do you? To the galaxy, they're the same thing; just men and women with too much power, squabbling over religion, while the rest of us burn.",
      "gblatton032.mp3": "Is this an interrogation? If so, you're terrible at it, especially for an ex-Jedi... or whatever you are. ",
      "gblatton033.mp3": "Why don't you just crawl in my head and try to dig out whatever you're looking for rather than asking about it? ",
      "gblatton030.mp3": "{Starting to get pissed}I'm as Atton as Atton will ever be, and whoever your trusted informant is, he's right, I did show up on Nar Shaddaa during the Jedi Civil War... along with a lot of other refugees. ",
      "gblatton145.mp3": "Yeah - I guess I just had to prove something to myself, and I never had a chance to put it to the test until then. ",
      "gblatton148.mp3": "I thought getting in touch with the Force might leave me more vulnerable - but it's actually made me stronger. ",
      "gblatton149.mp3": "So... uh, thanks. For helping me.",
      "gblatton152.mp3": "{A little firm, just been reprimanded}Right - I will. I won't let you down.",
      "gblatton151.mp3": "That's for sure.",
      "gblatton150.mp3": "So - something else on your mind?",
      "gblatton146.mp3": "{A little rueful}Nothing I didn't already know. ",
      "gblatton147.mp3": "Anyway, it's over now... at least until the next disaster hits us.",
      "gblatton142.mp3": "{Slight shame, slight anger at self}I don't really want to talk about it - we won, that's it. ",
      "gblatton143.mp3": "{Rueful}Yeah, well, we won the battle. That's about it.",
      "gblatton144.mp3": "I don't really want to talk about it.",
      "gblatton097.mp3": "Sounds good to me. I'll deal.",
      "gblatton094.mp3": "All right, but I'm out of credits, so it's Republic Senate rules. ",
      "gblatton402.mp3": "Sure, shouldn't be a problem. It's basically a numbers game, but I can give you the ground rules.",
      "gblatton095.mp3": "That's where we waste a lot of time trading cards and trying to beat each other, but in the end nobody wins, everybody loses, and nobody accomplishes anything. ",
      "gblatton096.mp3": "It's like stalemate, except the goal is to pass time until the audience gets bored and leaves. ",
      "gblatton401.mp3": "The repairs are coming along. I hope to have the Ebon Hawk ready by the time you finish your business here. ",
      "gblatton071.mp3": "Passes the time. It's better than listing off engine sequencers, memorizing hyperspace routes, or counting ticks in the power couplings.",
      "gblatton093.mp3": "{Suddenly serious}Of course it's fixed. And that's why you should count the ticking in the power coupling, too. ",
      "gblatton073.mp3": "Why do I play pazaak? All right, I'll show you. ",
      "gblatton077.mp3": "Good match... now, what are you thinking about right now?",
      "gblatton092.mp3": "{Scoffs, but becomes serious}Fair enough. But that's why I play pazaak in my head. ",
      "gblatton078.mp3": "{Serious, grim}Right. And that's why I play pazaak in my head. ",
      "gblatton079.mp3": "{Grim, quiet, accusing, trying to show the player something important}Because if you don't, you've left the door open. And anyone could walk right in. ",
      "gblatton091.mp3": "Nothing, I'm just someone who plays pazaak in his head. ",
      "gblatton081.mp3": "{Casual}No, I play pazaak in my head.",
      "gblatton082.mp3": "But while I'm doing that, it's a lot harder for someone to walk in. ",
      "gblatton083.mp3": "{Shakes his head, not looking at the player}No. I can only teach you to play pazaak. {Beat}Do you understand what I'm saying? ",
      "gblatton085.mp3": "{Firm, player now understand that pazaak is how Atton shields his mind}Good. Now you understand. ",
      "gblatton086.mp3": "All right, I'll deal, then. ",
      "gblatton087.mp3": "If you're ever fighting someone who has the power over your mind... whether light or dark... play pazaak. Start listing hyperspace routes. Recite engine sequencers.",
      "gblatton088.mp3": "And when they try to use their powers on you, suddenly it's not as easy as they thought.",
      "gblatton090.mp3": "Jedi do it all the time, and when they walk in the dark places of your mind, they'll use it to hold you by the throat.",
      "gblatton084.mp3": "{Shrugs}That's not something I can teach you - you've come to the wrong guy.",
      "gblatton080.mp3": "Of course you did. You see, Jedi... light or dark... do it, more often than you'd think. But I never heard one say they were sorry before... that's a new house rule.",
      "gblatton074.mp3": "We're not playing for credits. We're playing for something else. Are you going to play or not?",
      "gblatton076.mp3": "No, blasters stay in their holsters. Do you want to deal, or should I?",
      "gblatton075.mp3": "Nope, our clothes are gonna stay on. Do you want to deal, or should I?",
      "gblatton025.mp3": "{Noticing player falling to the dark side}Look, I know we've been through some rough times so far, but you need to stop letting it get to you.",

      "003003atton043.mp3": "Well, she sure could use it. It might do wonders for her mood, too. She's lucky she's a Jedi, or someone would've killed her years ago.",
      "003003atton042.mp3": "Yeah, to you, maybe. I don't usually hear much beyond 'fool' and 'imbecile.' She's lucky she's a Jedi, or someone would've killed her years ago.",
      "003003atton002.mp3": "What a surprise. {Irritated}Just so you Jedi know, the whole \"cryptic routine\" isn't mysterious, it's just irritating. {To himself}If you really can see the future, you should be at the pazaak table.",

      "003003atton004.mp3": "That's what I'm talking about. 'Jedi Talk.' You two should start your own little Jedi Academy.",

      "003003atton029.mp3": "{Challenging, suspicious}Don't give me that. There were plenty of times back on Peragus where a lightsaber would have been helpful. So - where's yours?",
      "003003atton030.mp3": "Oh, yeah? I thought a Jedi was supposed to be married to their lightsaber. Guess I heard wrong. Were you a single hilt or one of those double-bladed Jedi? ",
      "003003atton037.mp3": "{Probing}I thought a Jedi and their blade couldn't be parted. To lose it was like losing a part of yourself. ",
      "003003atton038.mp3": "All right - forget I said anything. Like I said before, you can check our course on the galaxy map if you want. It's on the wall behind you.",
      "003003atton033.mp3": "{A little impressed}Hnh. I hear the twin blades are harder to master, but they can make enemies stampede over each other running for cover.",
      "003003atton034.mp3": "Lot of Jedi in the Mandalorian Wars used double-bladed sabers - a more aggressive blade, gives you more slaughter per swing. Hey, you didn't go red, did you? ",
      "003003atton035.mp3": "Yeah, unique how?",
      "003003atton036.mp3": "Must have been something. Sure be nice to have it now - might make those Sith think twice before coming after us.",
      "003003atton031.mp3": "Hnh. Figures. It wasn't red, was it?",
      "003003atton032.mp3": "{Sarcastic}Great. Maybe you and that Sith Lord can have a party after we're dead. ",
      "003003atton017.mp3": "Oh no, no, no. Look, look, I respect your privacy. I mean, when have I ever asked you any questions? I mean, besides that one.",
      "003003atton018.mp3": "Not much, except sounds like it was after you. As far as I'm concerned, you handled that pretty well - {shrugs}no more droid, no more problem. ",
      "003003atton024.mp3": "Beats me. Sounds like you're pretty popular - if it was built to hunt you down, that is. It could have been around before you even appeared on the scene. ",
      "003003atton019.mp3": "Yeah, well you got me there. Look. Droids, I don't trust them. That one we fought? Some of them are built like that. Others just... well, break... in the head. ",
      "003003atton020.mp3": "Sometimes conflicting orders cause it. Give a droid too much data or tell it to do something it can't do, it'll crack their behavior module in half. ",
      "003003atton021.mp3": "{Looks at T3}Others just don't get memory wipes and they start going crazy.",
      "003003atton023.mp3": "Speaking of which, I think that little trash compactor's long overdue. Hnh. Trust me, droids were made to break. And most of all, they're predictable and stupid.  ",
      "003003atton110.mp3": "Well, the astrogation system is voice-printed and locked down, but that T3 unit is doubling as the astrogation system.",
      "003003atton111.mp3": "You can try to plot a course, but without that T3 unit to perform the calculations, you'd probably plow us into a star.",
      "003003atton112.mp3": "{Grumbles to himself}As long as he doesn't steal the ship, we should be all right. ",
      "003003atton114.mp3": "Takes all kinds. Maybe someone didn't want anybody taking the ship out of the system - or knowing where the ship had been. ",
      "003003atton115.mp3": "Smugglers do it all the time in case the Republic decides to board them... or so I hear.",
      "003003atton113.mp3": "I have no idea. Previous owner, maybe? I'd love to get it overhauled, but that's a major job - besides, the droid'll be good enough for now.",
      "003003atton013.mp3": "Whoa, all right, all right! Don't get mad at me. Hey, I didn't ask her to stay behind and get her hand cut off, okay?",
      "003003atton014.mp3": "{Apologetic}I mean - I appreciate what she did and all, but she could stand to lay off the insults herself, you know? ",
      "003003atton016.mp3": "Yeah? Well, how much water you get from a stone depends what planet you're on.",
      "003003atton015.mp3": "Oh yeah? Well, how much water you get from a stone depends what planet you're on, sister.",
      "003003atton010.mp3": "Hey, I just got out of prison. If we had a decent navicomputer, trust me, we'd be dropping out of hyperspace into the Nar Shaddaa Red Sector right now.",
      "003003atton011.mp3": "After spacing that old witch of course.",
      "003003atton007.mp3": "All right, cut it out, I get...I get it, I get it. The last Jedi in the galaxy, I get the comedian who runs around in her underwear. Not that I'm complaining, mind you.",

      "650attonend003.mp3": "The only thing that matters is the Handmaiden believes it. And she's going to react exactly how that old witch hoped she would.",
      "650attonend004.mp3": "That's why she wanted the Handmaiden on board, you know. So she could use her to reach the Telos Academy whenever she wished - without needing the access codes. ",
      "650attonend014.mp3": "She would, if she thought she was bringing Atris a prisoner. Especially a Sith Lord. ",

      "gblmandalore169.mp3": "But I also have faith in my people. Should we need the clans to fight the Sith, we will, and afterward, Revan will still have his army.",
      "gblmandalore197.mp3": "When I offered to go with her... she laughed. Then, she attacked me.",

      "gblmandalore188.mp3": "Revan, at his full power, was more than a match for me. The battle was over quickly - and then he made sure I couldn't follow him, even if I wanted to.",

      "gblmandalore049.mp3": "You've always been in the Jedi Order. Things that are common knowledge to you are rumors and stories to the rest of the galaxy.",
      "gblmandalore050.mp3": "We only knew what we had seen in holovids and from our experience with Exar Kun, and by that time he was completely a Sith.",
      "gblmandalore052.mp3": "What did you think of us?",
      "gblmandalore062.mp3": "You turned a demoralized, defeated mess into a coordinated army. You brought tactics, backbone, and above all else, victory, to them.",

      "gblmandalore131.mp3": "The Republic took us too lightly. We wanted to face the full force of their army. We had to goad them to fight.",

      "403mandalor039.mp3": "Kelborn told me that they were covert military and probably aligned with Colonel Tobin from Iziz{EYE-ziz}. Kelborn doesn't think they'll send out any more scouts.",
      "403mandalor040.mp3": "But that doesn't mean there aren't more of them out there.",
      "403mandalor041.mp3": "Colonel Tobin is General Vaklu's right-hand man. Despite his martial skill he handles himself as a functionary more than a warrior.",
      "403mandalor042.mp3": "Back when we were fighting Vaklu's resistance during the Mandalorian Wars, Vaklu wouldn't have any use for a poisonous kinrath like Tobin. But Vaklu seems to have adapted well to peacetime.",

      "403mandalor037.mp3": "That's to be expected. They don't really like it when someone makes loud noise in their territory.",
      "403mandalor038.mp3": "It wouldn't be much of a test if all you had to do was take a hike through the jungle now, would it? You're alive, in one piece, and learned something about the beasts of the jungle.",
      "403mandalor048.mp3": "How many cannoks did you have to kill to find those parts for Zuka? That was a tremendous help. I won't forget it.",
      "403mandalor069.mp3": "Xarga told me that you returned one of our sheep to the herd. You have gained some small prestige by helping Kumus.",
      "403mandalor047.mp3": "The gate guard said you managed to kill a zakkeg. Those are tough beasts, Jedi. You've earned some respect around here.",
      "403mandalor046.mp3": "Zuka told me you helped out with some repairs around the base. I was hoping you'd prove yourself more with a lightsaber, but it's certainly a great help.",
      "403mandalor045.mp3": "Kelborn said you dispatched some covert military scouts in the jungle with him. He spoke highly of your work.",
      "403mandalor044.mp3": "You defeated Bralor in the battle circle? Either you're very lucky, or you're a lot tougher than you look.",
      "403mandalor003.mp3": "So you're the intruder? Our sensors picked up your handiwork in space.",
      "403mandalor004.mp3": "I am Mandalore, leader of the Mandalorians.",
      "403mandalor031.mp3": "Mandalore is the name we give to our leader. Becoming Mandalore is the greatest honor any Mandalorian could aspire to. When our leader falls in battle, the most worthy takes his place.",
      "403mandalor032.mp3": "So even though your army killed our leader, it was only a matter of time before we chose someone new. Me.",
      "403mandalor011.mp3": "So, it's transportation you want? It so happens I have a small shuttle that's more than capable of running the Onderon military blockade.",
      "403mandalor012.mp3": "I make occasional trips to Iziz{EYE-ziz} for information and supplies. If you want to go with me, you're going to have to prove your worth.",
      "403mandalor028.mp3": "I don't travel with anyone I'm not sure of. You look capable, but Iziz{EYE-ziz} can be a dangerous place. If you want to travel on my shuttle, I want to make sure you aren't going to be a liability.",
      "403mandalor029.mp3": "I'll let Kex know that you check out. We've found more gear than we can use, so you can trade with him if you need some more supplies.",
      "403mandalor030.mp3": "Be careful in the jungle. Our patrols have stopped until the space traffic dies down. The challenging beasts have been cleared from the area, but what's left might still be too much for you.",
      "403mandalor025.mp3": "It's Mandalorian business, not yours.",
      "403mandalor027.mp3": "[Failure] I could - but I don't know you. Once I get to know you I might tell you more, but not now.",

      "403mandalor013.mp3": "Figure it out yourself. Ask around, see if you can make yourself useful. Or something that'll show what you're made of.",
      "403mandalor014.mp3": "There is one thing. Before your ship landed we were preparing some demolition work. All the activity forced my men to stop before they finished.",
      "403mandalor015.mp3": "The charges need to be detonated before anybody comes across them. So all you'd have to do is flip a switch.",
      "403mandalor018.mp3": "We were trying to uncover the entrance to a hidden cache of old Mandalorian equipment. The explosives should be easy to find. Just get to it before the cannoks do.",
      "403mandalor022.mp3": "They're not much more than a couple of plasteel cylinders. Before you get any bright ideas, if you uncover cache B13 leave it alone.",
      "403mandalor023.mp3": "Even if you survive the traps, it would require military-grade explosives to open without the proper access codes. What's inside belongs to the Mandalorians.",
      "403mandalor019.mp3": "The last months before Dxun fell, the old Mandalore knew that Revan and the Republic were gaining the upper hand.",
      "403mandalor020.mp3": "He ordered our best engineers to hide caches of weapons and munitions throughout the moon, safely away from the enemies' hands.",
      "403mandalor016.mp3": "We want to keep a low profile, so we've recalled all our patrols in the jungle. Setting off some high explosives isn't a textbook example of subtlety.",
      "403mandalor007.mp3": "This used to be the heart of the Mandalorian war effort. {Lots of pride here}From this complex we commanded an armada that had the Republic on the run. {Statement of fact with no malice}It didn't last.",
      "403mandalor010.mp3": "Covert camps are not meant to attract attention. Because we conquered them, the people of Onderon still hold a grudge against the Mandalorians. So we keep our presence here a secret.",
      "403mandalor008.mp3": "Mandalorians have a rapport with this jungle. Every moment here is a struggle, all creatures gripped in a constant war for survival.",
      "403mandalor009.mp3": "The sole purpose of the weak is to feed the strong. We train here and learn the lessons of the jungle. The beasts also help us keep our edge.",

      "403kelborn044.mp3": "You are that eager for a rematch? So am I, Jedi. You're more of a challenge than most of my brothers. Talk to the sergeant, I'm sure it can be arranged.",
      "403kelborn041.mp3": "We're taught not to. Mandalorians want to be tested to the limits of our abilities and beyond. We admire anyone who beats us on the battlefield.",
      "403kelborn042.mp3": "Instead of hate we study, practice and train until the next time, so we won't be beaten. But some young Mandalorians find this a hard lesson.",

      "403kelborn011.mp3": "I doubt that Queen Talia and her advisor will survive until nightfall.",
      "403kelborn012.mp3": "The balance of forces seemed to favor Queen Talia. The Royal Palace is heavily fortified and defensible, and most of the soldiers are loyal to her.",
      "403kelborn013.mp3": "But Vaklu has new allies: Sith soldiers and their masters. The war has also driven the caged beasts in the streets mad.",
      "403kelborn014.mp3": "Bralor{BRAY-lor} and I both concur. She doesn't stand a chance.",
      "403kelborn017.mp3": "Y - Yes, yes we have. How... ? We picked up some transmissions from nearby in the jungle.",
      "403kelborn020.mp3": "We only have our shuttle sensors, so we know nothing more than that.",
      "403kelborn028.mp3": "Mandalorian warriors will go with you to find the enemy camp. Just let me know when you want to head out.",
      "403kelborn029.mp3": "If you need supplies, talk with Kex. After you get into the jungle you might not have another opportunity to stock up.",
      "403kelborn030.mp3": "Let me know if you want to go now.",
      "403kelborn031.mp3": "As you wish. Mandalore has arranged for special transportation to get to Iziz.",
      "403kelborn018.mp3": "Zuka's satellite relay has also picked up several shuttle launches with old Sith transmitter IDs. Some sort of staging base, perhaps.",
      "403kelborn010.mp3": "I'm afraid so. I doubt that Queen Talia and her advisor will survive until nightfall.",
      "403kelborn046.mp3": "You received my message, then? Colonel Tobin contacted us.",
      "403kelborn047.mp3": "He arranged safe passage to Onderon for you. But I don't know if his offer still stands.",
      "403kelborn067.mp3": "The Colonel has transmitted the tomb's coordinates, and I've got a strike force of Mandalorians ready to go.",
      "403kelborn051.mp3": "The war is part of their plans? Then perhaps his invitation is still valid. There is a great deal of chaos on the streets of Iziz, but I can try to contact Colonel Tobin.",
      "403kelborn004.mp3": "Are you ready to head to the enemy base? It will be a long journey through the jungle.",
      "403kelborn003.mp3": "Does your journey go well? Last communication I heard indicates that the war still rages on Iziz.",
      "403kelborn001.mp3": "I hear you handled Iziz adequately. Mandalore has left me in charge until he has finished his journey to reuinite the clans.",
      "403kelborn002.mp3": "If there is any change planetside I'll send you a message.",
      "402sentry014.mp3": "Stop, right there. You are not permitted into our camp without an escort.",
      "402sentry002.mp3": "Mostly cannoks and maalraas. Deeper in the jungle, there's boma beasts, and they're a little more sport.",
      "402sentry008.mp3": "Bomas are tough and fiercely territorial. Whenever we drive them off, they just come back to reclaim their grazing lands.",
      "402sentry015.mp3": "Hold it right there. We've got you surrounded.",
      "403bralor010.mp3": "So the Jedi Order isn't completely dead. You always had hidden strengths - very hard for even the wisest Mandalore to judge and predict.",
      "403bralor011.mp3": "{He speaks with respect - he holds the Jedi no animosity for beating him, just admiration}I have studied much of the Jedi since our defeat. I would be honored to cross blades with you in the battle circle.",
      "403bralor015.mp3": "You talk with the sergeant. Today is his day to preside over the circle. Each fight is different because the Mandalorian with greater honor dictates the terms of the engagement.",
      "403bralor016.mp3": "But there will be no terms if we fight. Everyone else will deny you your lightsaber and the use of your \"Force.\"",
      "403bralor014.mp3": "Perhaps we can learn from one another, in time.",
      "403bralor022.mp3": "I could only do that if I observed you fight an enemy in real combat. I have seen your matches so far, and I do not doubt your worthiness to face me.",
      "403bralor023.mp3": "But the rules cannot be changed. The other champion, Kelborn, is in the jungle on a mission. Perhaps your paths will cross, and you will have your opportunity there.",
      "403bralor007.mp3": "Before the Mandalorian Wars we looked at Jedi as weak. Their code restricted their full potential. The Jedi were limited by a narrow sense of morality that couldn't survive a real war.",
      "403bralor008.mp3": "But our view was the narrow one. I see that clearly now. I sense we've both learned something today. We can fight again if you like.",
      "403bralor005.mp3": "And so I lose again. I still have much to learn. The last Jedi I fought was in a ship-to-ship battle on Malachor V. I lost, but was spared.",
      "403bralor002.mp3": "But the Sith change everything. Because of their aid, Vaklu stands poised to win this war.",
      "403bralor024.mp3": "Even if Vaklu is successful in usurping Queen Talia, in the long run alliances with the Sith never end well.",
      "403bralor021.mp3": "General Vaklu will make a formidable ally for you.",
      "403bralor020.mp3": "I hear that your help was instrumental to Queen Talia's victory in the civil war.",
      "403gategrd009.mp3": "But without our patrols some of the larger beasts may be around. None of us will be around to bail you out of trouble. You've been warned.",
      "403gategrd026.mp3": "{Implying the player can't handle a zakkeg at end}We heard reports of a zakkeg wandering the paths around there. They're a good challenge - for Mandalorians. ",

      "403gategrd002.mp3": "Well, as quiet as the beasts of Dxun ever let it get.",
      "403kex024.mp3": "I'm Kex, the new quartermaster. If a Mandalorian needs something, they come to me.",
      "403kex025.mp3": "{Irritated that Mandalore gave the player permission}Mandalore's ordered me to let you have access to our supplies, including some military-grade surplus.",
      "403kex038.mp3": "The only advice I'll give you is when you're in the jungle, shoot anything that moves. Then shoot the things that don't move, just to be sure.",
      "403kex031.mp3": "The greatest honor for a Mandalorian is to distinguish themselves in battle. But as age comes upon us, some are forced to find honor in other pursuits.",
      "403kex032.mp3": "They assist as freighter pilots, technicians, or quartermasters. There is honor there, but it's nothing compared to the heat of battle.",
      "403kex033.mp3": "{Bitter}For someone young like me, this task is distasteful. There are many battles left in me. Yet I am relegated to... this.",
      "403kex035.mp3": "The old quartermaster was carrying out a load of blast converters and walked straight into a beam splitter. Pieces of him wound up all over. ",
      "403kex036.mp3": "So I got the job. And here I am.",
      "403kex028.mp3": "{Challenging}Yeah, I do. I don't know why Mandalore would let some outsider roam around our camp without an escort.",
      "403kex030.mp3": "I won't - as long as the Mandalore's orders stand. If he wants you dead, though, then I'm going to be the first one gunning for you.",
      "403kex027.mp3": "Blasters, energy shields, armor, and other fighting gear. All in good condition - though I doubt you could afford it.",
      "403kex041.mp3": "You here to gloat over your victories in the battle circle? Save it for someone else.",
      "403kex010.mp3": "I... do, Mandalore. I don't trust him. ",
      "403kex012.mp3": "No, Mandalore, I do not. The stranger may be a spy for Onderon or the Republic.",
      "403kex045.mp3": "{He hates having to do this}Kelborn told me to give you these. He said it would help you out.",
      "403mandalor064.mp3": "I don't blame you. They're a sad people. I have some things to look into. I'll talk to you later.",
      "403mandalor063.mp3": "Which is unfortunate because their animosity towards Mandalorians makes it inconvenient to go there.",
      "403mandalor060.mp3": "The people of Onderon don't possess the resolve and strength needed in these times. Many of them want to break away from the Republic.",
      "403mandalor035.mp3": "Ask around the camp. Someone else might have something you can do to lend a hand.",
      "403mandalor024.mp3": "Cannoks are nothing more than pests, but they have a real talent for screwing up plans. Just get to those explosives in the next day or so, and you'll be fine.",
      "403mandalor017.mp3": "You asked if there was anything you could do, and I told you. Nothing in this jungle is as simple as it seems, though.",
      "403mandalor001.mp3": "So you're the one that picked a fight with my sentries. The sensors also picked up your battle in space. You've had a pretty busy day.",

      "403xarga011.mp3": "You found Kumus - and alive, no less. I suppose I should offer my gratitude. He's got a mind like a stunned mynock, but he's got courage.",
      "403xarga012.mp3": "{A little prodding}He was evasive when I asked him what happened, however. Trying to survive in the jungle must have taken its toll.",

      "gblhandmaiden077.mp3": "It is not a sensitive subject, but a subject that requires trust. There is no such trust between you and I, and such trust takes time.",
      "gblhandmaiden076.mp3": "There is no need to apologize. You were merely remarking on something that you saw - there is no wrong in that. ",
      "gblhandmaiden061.mp3": "That is not all she says. She says you know nothing of loyalty to any cause except your own animal instincts, and she told us why you fell to the dark side.",
      "gblhandmaiden063.mp3": "Atris says when the dark lord Revan returned to the Republic, you did not march with them because you had fallen so far you could no longer feel the Force. ",
      "gblhandmaiden072.mp3": "So it was a matter of choice, then. If Atris has erred in her evaluation of your motivations, it might be best to inform her.",
      "gblhandmaiden064.mp3": "I believe that is the extent of her expressed feelings toward you. There are variations at times, but all rise from the same foundation. ",
      "gblhandmaiden065.mp3": "Yes. It is difficult sometimes for others to truly speak their heart or listen to it. The words often prove difficult, or they do not come at all.",
      "gblhandmaiden067.mp3": "Battle is a pure form of expression. It is heart and discipline, reduced to movement and motion.",
      "gblhandmaiden071.mp3": "I do not think the battle would go as you describe, but in essence, yes.",
      "gblhandmaiden069.mp3": "Perhaps. It may prove truer than conversing with words.",
      "gblhandmaiden070.mp3": "In battle, the words are swept away, giving way to actions - mercy, sacrifice, anger, fear. These are pure moments of expression.",
      "gblhandmaiden043.mp3": "I know a little of them, yes. Much Jedi knowledge is stored here, secrets of their teachings, combat styles, and discipline.",
      "gblhandmaiden044.mp3": "The Jedi relics are kept by Atris, within the walls of her meditation chamber. Entry is forbidden.",
      "gblhandmaiden059.mp3": "{Hesitating for once, knows she shouldn't be saying anything}I... I have seen a few of them, yes. They were not always in Atris' meditation chamber. ",

      "gblhandmaiden058.mp3": "I am not permitted to speak of such things, and it is not your concern.",
      "gblhandmaiden046.mp3": "[Failure] Atris has made her orders on the matter clear, and she says you are no Jedi.",
      "gblhandmaiden047.mp3": "Entry to her meditation chamber is forbidden. To even ask shows you doubt my loyalty to her.",
      "gblhandmaiden052.mp3": "Yes, their questions were... confusing. They seemed to think I was someone else, someone's student.",

      "gblhandmaiden037.mp3": "Yes, watch them for signs of the corruption that took place during the Jedi Civil War. Such vigilance requires those not tied to the Force or its influence.",
      "gblhandmaiden034.mp3": "There is much in their approach to battle that is worthy to be shared.",
      "gblhandmaiden032.mp3": "To the Echani, battle is a means of communication - it is an art, in the truest sense of the word.",
      "gblhandmaiden010.mp3": "Stance, form, discipline are a means of expression and communication. They speak one's heart and one's devotion to their cause. ",

      "gblhandmaiden013.mp3": "When Taris was destroyed, it showed Malak's heart through its execution and intent. It was brutal, without finesse... but showed his commitment to defeat the Jedi.",
      "gblhandmaiden014.mp3": "Yet with Revan, there was the same commitment, but it was a subtle thing, like weaving threads in a tapestry, or strokes upon a canvas. ",
      "gblhandmaiden029.mp3": "She spoke through battle and tactics in a way one could never do in words. She showed her heart at Malachor V, and finally at the end of the Jedi Civil War. ",

      "gblhk47287.mp3": "Observation: It was not something discussed with much of the others, but I think Revan recognized that a single Jedi, both in the past and in the present, could turn the tide of a conflict.",
      "gblhk47288.mp3": "So my targets were frequently Jedi, or someone close to a Jedi that could result in their corruption or collapse. Revan often assigned me to kill leaders or supporters of certain Jedi so as to erode their will. ",

      "gblhk47341.mp3": "{Shakes head before \"silly Jedi.\"}Answer: Select grenades, sonic screamers, cluster rockets, and plasma charges. Mines are also effective, since many Jedi will run to meet you in hand to hand combat. {Smiles}Silly Jedi.",

      "gblhk47347.mp3": "Confession: I do not fully understand their other abilities, but I do know that many of them require that the Jedi know that you are there, and can see you. ",
      "gblhk47348.mp3": "Thus, sniping and using cover are always advantageous. ",
      "gblhk47349.mp3": "Evaluation: A technique that Revan used frequently was to attack a Jedi indirectly. This method only works if the Jedi is adhering to the self-destructive path of pacifism and sacrifice. ",
      "gblhk47350.mp3": "Answer: Kill their allies, or place them in jeopardy. Many Jedi will leave themselves exposed in order to protect another. ",
      "gblhk47351.mp3": "That is why there is many less Jedi than there were a decade ago.",
      "gblhk47356.mp3": "Answer: No, master. In addition to traps, mines, and orbital bombardment, Revan and the Sith often employed meatbag assassins for some Jedi, skilled in the same techniques that I was trained in.",
      "gblhk47357.mp3": "Strangely enough, Revan believed that meatbags that did not use or believe in the Force were especially important, since in many respects, they were more difficult for Jedi to detect. ",
      "gblhk47358.mp3": "Revan had many of them trained to \"hide their minds,\" as it were. Again, once these techniques were learned, the percentage of living Jedi began to decrease accordingly.",
      "gblhk47359.mp3": "Answer: Generally, this was done by broadcasting strong emotions while thinking about something else. It was a curious technique, but it seemed to be effective in blinding Jedi. ",
      "gblhk47360.mp3": "Whether guilt, lust, fear - they act as mental interference, making finding the true intentions of the broadcasting meatbag difficult. ",
      "gblhk47361.mp3": "Answer: Obviously, a Force Sensitive broadcasting such emotions puts themselves at risk of not using the Force \"properly,\" since to use it seems to require an inner calm that most meatbags do not possess. ",
      "gblhk47362.mp3": "As much as the Jedi could not use such a technique, the Sith Lords cannot use it for much the same reasons - such passions as guilt, lust, and fear are rarely strengths to the Sith code. ",
      "gblhk47363.mp3": "Statement: The master felt it was ironic that only people who had experienced such passions could harm Jedi in such a way - that to kill Jedi, you had to be a human being. Revan found that quite amusing.",
      "gblhk47382.mp3": "Answer: Perhaps I will elaborate on them at another time, master. I do not wish to reveal all such techniques in case it leaves me no recourse should I need to terminate you.",
      "gblhk47364.mp3": "Answer: The odds of me being forced to use such techniques against you has decreased, master. There are some more methods I could describe, if you wish.",
      "gblhk47365.mp3": "Statement: Overwhelming odds is also a good tactic, master. There are few Jedi that can long hold their ground against a hundred attackers all firing at once... or being turned on by their own troops.",
      "gblhk47366.mp3": "But the most effective weapon against Jedi seems to be the erosion of the spirit.",
      "gblhk47367.mp3": "Answer: Revan claimed that psychological warfare against Jedi was important because much of their power comes from their state of mind, their connection to this religion called the \"Force.\"",
      "gblhk47368.mp3": "{This is very important, this is what the player can do on a vast scale}Revan said that many Jedi have the capability to form connections to life around them, although few of them realized the extent to which this is possible.",
      "gblhk47369.mp3": "Recollection: I believe my Master speculated that many Jedi did not fully form such connections because of their discipline, because they never opened their lives to the passions around them. ",
      "gblhk47370.mp3": "I believe Revan termed it that \"one would need to be a human being to develop such connections.\" It is something that the Jedi code could not teach. One simply knew it instinctively, or not.",
      "gblhk47371.mp3": "Observation: Master, I am somewhat surprised that I need to explain this to you at all, considering your past with Revan.",
      "gblhk47951.mp3": "Answer: Why, she said you had such capability, master, but it would be your downfall. To tie so much of yourself into others - if they suffer or die, then you would die as well.",
      "gblhk47372.mp3": "Answer: Why, he said you had such capability, master, but it would be your downfall. To tie so much of yourself into others - if they suffer or die, then you would die as well.",
      "gblhk47373.mp3": "Observation: I think Revan pitied you, master. It was very insulting, if I may say so.",
      "gblhk47374.mp3": "Clarification: Whatever it is called, master, it seems to be quite a vulnerability. Revan even admitted as such. ",
      "gblhk47375.mp3": "When a Jedi, or any soldier, suffers doubt, it weakens them. With the Jedi, however, it is more pronounced, since they are extreme examples. ",
      "gblhk47376.mp3": "That is why Revan felt that Malachor V was so important. It was intended to be a conversion tool. ",
      "gblhk47377.mp3": "Assessment: When faced with a continuous series of hard-fought battles, I detected a significant statistical increase in Jedi following Revan over the Jedi Code - a compromise in principles brought about by battlefield conditions.",
      "gblhk47378.mp3": "The emotional weight of war changed Jedi morale, power, and eventually, their allegiance. ",
      "gblhk47379.mp3": "Conclusion: I believe the Mandalorian Wars were to beat the Mandalorians and also to allow Revan to build the foundation of his army.  ",
      "gblhk47380.mp3": "But I am surprised you have not already arrived at this conclusion. ",
      "gblhk47381.mp3": "Surely the loss of your troops and the Jedi who served under you at Malachor V, had a detrimental effect upon you and your ties to the Force - and I suspect, your desire to be around others ever again. ",

      "gblhk47218.mp3": "Answer: No, master, I do not. I am afraid I have been out of touch with the Sith for many years. ",
      "gblhk47219.mp3": "This new Sith threat fights differently than the ones I was familiar with - these seem to favor stealth and assassination to achieve their ends. ",
      "gblhk47220.mp3": "Answer: No, master. The Sith had many hidden bases and strongholds before and during the Jedi Civil War, and I doubt the Republic found them all.",
      "gblhk47221.mp3": "Theory: It is possible that the Sith still hold one such base - if not several.",

      "gblhk47236.mp3": "Statement: My apologies, master, but that device seems to know all the languages I do, and I am feeling degrees of familiarity and inferiority both at once.",

      "gblhk47226.mp3": "Answer: Because it seems to know all the languages I do, and I am feeling degrees of familiarity and inferiority both at once.",

      "gblhk47228.mp3": "{Studying object}Indeed, it seems to be modeled after my vocabulator, with some modifications, of course. Curious. You say you obtained this device on Peragus?",
      "gblhk47229.mp3": "Observation: Master, I do believe this device serves multiple functions - including tracking your position. It is sending out a passive carrier wave that signals itself to HK units in the vicinity.",

      "gblhk47966.mp3": "Answer: Master, the nature of the signal from the sonic imprint sensor is such that we must wait until it is signaled. ",
      "gblhk47967.mp3": "It does not please me any more than it does you, but one of the primary traits of an assassin... or assassin droid... is patience.",
      "gblhk47383.mp3": "Answer: Master, when conventional weapons will not work, then one must resort to other means of assassination. ",
      "gblhk47384.mp3": "When Jedi... or Sith... or whatever they call themselves, cannot be defeated with weapons, then use doubt. ",

      "gblhk47386.mp3": "It may be whatever pain he experienced in the past was so great, that the technique he used to recover from it... and sustain himself... also gives him an incredibly high pain threshold. ",
      "gblhk47387.mp3": "Answer: Well, master, you have heard of Jedi healing techniques - that is certainly possible. The Sith may have their equivalent, although it seems known only to this particular Sith Lord.",

      "gblhk47392.mp3": "If his strength comes from his connection to the Force, then you must undermine that connection, master.",
      "gblhk47393.mp3": "Answer: Doubt, master. It has killed many Jedi... and it has killed many Sith.",
      "gblhk47394.mp3": "Make him doubt himself, his beliefs, or his intentions. Such things disrupt connections to the Force - and death soon follows.",

      "gblhk47952.mp3": "[Influence: Failure] Answer: Master, ironically enough, I seem to have developed a sudden bout of memory loss. I shall struggle to recall an answer to your question, but for now, it is sadly beyond my capabilities. ",

      "gblhk47108.mp3": "{Disgusted by the clones}Statement: Ah... yes, them. Very well. What did you wish to know?",
      "gblhk47176.mp3": "Answer: My 'feelings' on the matter are something that I feel I must put in proper context - in a way that even a meatbag such as yourself could easily comprehend.  ",
      "gblhk47177.mp3": "Theory: Imagine, if you will, that you are unique. The pinnacle of an exiled, cast-out Jedi who can't even use the Force. ",
      "gblhk47178.mp3": "Imagine that no one has sunk lower than you. That you are truly the most miserable example of a Jedi ever.",
      "gblhk47179.mp3": "Continuation: Now that you have that image, imagine this - someone clones you. Badly, I might add. ",
      "gblhk47180.mp3": "They make the clones talk differently, rob you of any shred of personality, and take your Jedi Code and adjust it so that it is not really the Jedi Code anymore. ",
      "gblhk47181.mp3": "They even change your pigmentation to a rather poor shade of durasteel, rather than the proper rusty red that inspires fear in targets.",
      "gblhk47182.mp3": "And of course, they refer to meatbags as \"organics.\" Unacceptable.",
      "gblhk47185.mp3": "Clarification: \"Anger\" would be an understatement for the heat that builds up in my behavior core when these cheap imitations make their presence felt throughout the galaxy. ",
      "gblhk47186.mp3": "{More to himself}Statement: Part of the indignity of all these copies is that they impair my ability to perform my function. ",
      "gblhk47187.mp3": "The more people throughout the galaxy recognize me as an illegal assassination device, the more difficulty I will have in carrying out my mission.",
      "gblhk47183.mp3": "Indignation: Have you gone deaf? Surely you've heard them speak and instantly you can tell the difference between them and I.",
      "gblhk47184.mp3": "Statement: If master would just listen to their voices - their voices sound nothing like me; they have none of the looping, static-filled sinister background hiss that I am known for. ",
      "gblhk47173.mp3": "Answer: I do not know why these clones chose now to start revealing themselves. ",
      "gblhk47174.mp3": "Theory: I can only assume that some critical moment is approaching where stealth and subtlety is no longer required. Not that those durasteel-plated knockoffs know anything of stealth or subtlety. ",
      "gblhk47175.mp3": "Observation: It is clear, however, that they have been placed throughout the galaxy at critical junctures, both in the Republic fleet and in neutral worlds. And they seem to be looking for Jedi. ",
      "gblhk47135.mp3": "Answer: Master, as part of my original programming, I am able to communicate in over six hundred languages. ",
      "gblhk47136.mp3": "This usually amounted to short verbal warnings when killing non-Basic speaking targets, which gave me some small measure of satisfaction.",
      "gblhk47137.mp3": "Answer: Yes. I believe my original Master needed this functionality in order to recover information from various indigenous tribes across the galaxy, but I know little else than that. ",
      "gblhk47138.mp3": "{Disgust at \"copies\"}Suffice to say that that translation capability allowed these... copies of myself to assume the role of protocol and translation droids in much of known space.",
      "gblhk47139.mp3": "That is, of course, not their primary function. And while they are attempting to pass themselves off as translation droids, their primary functionality keeps rising to the forefront. ",
      "gblhk47158.mp3": "Answer: {Sigh}Master, being a meatbag, your answer does not surprise me.",
      "gblhk47159.mp3": "You see, part of the reason an assassin droid is so effective is because it is a droid. Meatbags tend not to notice us, we are treated as furnishings. ",
      "gblhk47161.mp3": "Statement: Oh, do shut up, you beeping little trash compactor. ",
      "gblhk47162.mp3": "Anyway, as I was saying, droids tend to blend into the background. Like a bench. Or a card table.",

      "gblhk47170.mp3": "{Dismissive}Answer: Oh, who knows, master. It is evident that the Sith would very much like to assassinate all the Jedi. Which is somewhat the equivalent of cultural suicide, since some Sith are Jedi or were Jedi. ",
      "gblhk47171.mp3": "It is much like the circumstance I find myself in now. How do you kill such an integral part of yourself over such ethical differences?",
      "gblhk47172.mp3": "The answer, of course, is that you keep firing until all dissension has been eradicated.",
      "gblhk47140.mp3": "Recitation: For example, on Praven Prime, the simple transferring of L'Xing syntax for 'friendship' changes its meaning - and implies that one's brood mate was actually impregnated by their own host.",

      "gblhk47144.mp3": "Confirmation: Oh, truly. You can imagine the results. ",
      "gblhk47145.mp3": "Statement: This comment, of course, caused a civil war between the Gu-vandi Collective and L'Xing that still persists to the current date.",
      "gblhk47146.mp3": "Answer: Yes, master, such incidents often spread outwards from their point of origin, much like an echo.",
      "gblhk47150.mp3": "Answer: In the case of Praven Prime, the civil war actually forced the Republic to back out of Gu-vandi space and let their world fall from Republic control. ",
      "gblhk47151.mp3": "As I understand it, that would be best. Keeping such a world would have been a token gesture of control.",
      "gblhk47152.mp3": "As an added burden, the resources needed to invest in diplomatic and trade relations would have far outweighed what would have been required.",
      "gblhk47153.mp3": "Besides, master, quite frankly, the Gu-vandi and L'Xing needed a good war. They were races that relied more on words than actions, and a good, brisk killing woke them from their torpid state.",
      "gblhk47154.mp3": "Also, the result of the war will be that the drastically reduced L'Xing population will eventually need to call upon the Republic for emergency relief.",
      "gblhk47155.mp3": "Answer: The Republic stands to gain. The Republic will be able to supply such emergency relief at a fraction of the cost to the now-reduced population. ",
      "gblhk47156.mp3": "Of course, such aid would only come four or five years after the war was started. One would have to be patient and let death and destruction run its course. ",
      "gblhk47147.mp3": "{Slightly confused}Query: What do you mean, master?",

      "gblhk47149.mp3": "Still, somehow it seemed applicable to this situation. Odd. ",
      "gblhk47125.mp3": "Answer: Well, master, it seems you have become a popular individual in the galaxy. ",
      "gblhk47126.mp3": "This is somewhat surprising to me, since this dissemination of information could not have been caused by your actions alone.",
      "gblhk47127.mp3": "Statement: Master, there is mention of you specifically in the coreward databases, even in public terminals on Coruscant. ",
      "gblhk47128.mp3": "Observation: I was led to believe that this information concerning Jedi was not for public consumption, yet somehow it has been made known to them.",
      "gblhk47129.mp3": "Conclusion: Someone wants everyone to know that you exist, master. And that you are back in Republic space. ",
      "gblhk47130.mp3": "If I did not know better, which is computationally impossible, I believe that someone wants to make you a target, and they are succeeding admirably. ",
      "gblhk47131.mp3": "Answer: Master, my feeling would be the Exchange. But that doesn't seem to be enough to answer the question, however. ",
      "gblhk47132.mp3": "Rhetorical: Why wouldn't they have simply kept the information to themselves? Such an answer does not address the central question. ",
      "gblhk47133.mp3": "And that is, why someone would choose to broadcast your location all over the known galaxy. ",
      "gblhk47134.mp3": "Theory: My suspicion is that someone is using you as bait for a larger target, who is unknown at this time. ",
      "gblhk47121.mp3": "Statement: Master, there are two reasons for this. ",
      "gblhk47122.mp3": "One, the probability of them showing up around you is statistically high. If I travel with you, then my chances of encountering these clones is also high.",
      "gblhk47123.mp3": "The second reason is a little more complicated. You see, even though those clones are obviously cheap, artless imitations of me... well, they are still me.",
      "gblhk47124.mp3": "Answer: Somehow these droids are built from my schematics. This causes certain complications.",
      "gblhk47111.mp3": "Answer: Master, I do not know. I have tried in vain to find it, but so far the location of the factory churning out these copies has eluded me. ",
      "gblhk47116.mp3": "Statement: I have no idea, Master.",
      "gblhk47117.mp3": "Statement: Oh no, master, surely you are mistaken. I would never malfunction in such a way on purpose. ",
      "gblhk47118.mp3": "Prompt: Do you understand me? I. Have. No. Idea. It certainly isn't a matter of it being locked in my memory core and being unable to communicate it to others. ",
      "gblhk47119.mp3": "Answer: I fear that any such information that exists would only come out when a certain sequence of events takes place.",
      "gblhk47120.mp3": "That is why I am eager to encounter more of these clones in the hopes that something clicks that allows me to finally pull the trigger.",
      "gblhk47964.mp3": "Answer: Master, I do not know. The location of the factory churning out these copies eludes me. ",
      "gblhk47112.mp3": "I am worried that there may also be some mental block in my circuits that is preventing me from recognizing where their factory is.",
      "gblhk47113.mp3": "{Musing}And I do not know where they would have obtained schematics of my design. They are built from my template, of that I know for certain.",
      "gblhk47114.mp3": "Answer: Because of my self-preservation program. My behavior core recognizes these templates as still being me, despite their individuality.",
      "gblhk47115.mp3": "I could no more shoot them than I could shoot myself. It is a frustrating situation that has been looping through my behavior core for some time. ",
      "gblhk47109.mp3": "Recitation: I believe it is a passive tracking device, designed to relay our position to HK units in the area. ",
      "gblhk47110.mp3": "Theory: I believe if we were to encounter three separate squads of HK units, we could use this device to triangulate their base of operations.",
      "gblhk47233.mp3": "Answer: Master, I have a suspicion all we need to do is wait. They will come to us, I believe. ",
      "gblhk47234.mp3": "Answer: Then their base of operations will remain a secret, and we will be no better off than we were before. ",
      "gblhk47272.mp3": "Answer: Oh, that is impossible, master. If I were out to kill you, we would not be speaking. ",
      "gblhk47273.mp3": "{A little prideful}And regardless, I am a unique model. Why, to think that there would be other versions of me would be unacceptable.",
      "gblhk47955.mp3": "{Almost trying to convince himself}Statement: Master, I must inform you that your attempts at humor are wasted on a droid such as I. As I have expressed, I am unique. ",
      "gblhk47956.mp3": "Resignation: Very well, Master, if you persist in your attempts at humor, I shall indulge you. Let me check the ship's records, and we will settle this matter once and for all. ",
      "gblhk47957.mp3": "Conclusion: You speak the truth. {Beat at second sentence}This discovery is also causing me some degree of anger. And humiliation. ",
      "gblhk47958.mp3": "{Are you okay, sarcastic}Mockery: \"Am I all right?\" Oh, yes, master, why, I am fine.",
      "gblhk47959.mp3": "Statement: I mean, I have only just been re-activated, only to find that there are sub-standard duplicates of me running all over the galaxy, corroding my good name.",
      "gblhk47960.mp3": "But if they are, in fact, hunting you, then I look forward to the opportunity to meet these units - and educate them in proper assassination protocols. ",
      "gblhk47961.mp3": "Conclusion: So it seems I need you - for the time being. ",
      "gblhk47962.mp3": "Answer: I do not know, Master. It is curious that I was here - although this place does seem familiar. ",
      "gblhk47963.mp3": "Extrapolation: Perhaps someone was already in the process of rebuilding me. It may be I was needed for some task.",
      "gblhk47104.mp3": "Query: {Lying}Indeed? I was unaware that the navicomputer was locked.",
      "gblhk47105.mp3": "{Being cagey}Statement: Yes, I heard it was voice-printed. Most curious.",
      "gblhk47106.mp3": "Statement: I suppose so, master, but I would need to know who voice-locked it. And regrettably, I do not have that knowledge.",
      "gblhk47107.mp3": "It seems to me that we will have to accept the T3's astrogation abilities for the time being. It is a very... loyal and dependable droid, for its class.",
      "gblhk47021.mp3": "Statement: Very well, master. But if you wish to be brutal and vicious about it, know that I am trained for such things. Do your worst. ",
      "gblhk47020.mp3": "Statement: Oh, yes, master. Pain is really the only reliable means by which truth may be obtained. Or so I choose to believe.",
      "gblhk47005.mp3": "{A little irritated, sullen}Statement: HK-47 is ready to serve, master.",
      "gblhk47006.mp3": "Observation: Notice that I did not ask if you need anyone killed. You may be curious as to why.",
      "gblhk47007.mp3": "Answer: That is because you told me to stop asking if you needed anyone killed. So I have. From now on, I will simply say, \"I am ready to serve.\"",
      "gblhk47008.mp3": "{Irritated}Yes, ready to serve. In whatever way a common protocol or utility droid might serve. It seems that is my lot in life. Not to kill.",
      "gblhk47013.mp3": "Answer: It is a start, master, and as such, is acceptable.",
      "gblhk47012.mp3": "{Slight grumble}Answer: As you wish, master. ",
      "gblhk47009.mp3": "{Reprimanding}Observation: You are indeed cruel, master. You might as well ask an organic meatbag not to breathe. ",
      "gblhk47010.mp3": "{Becomes slightly pleading toward the end}If you happen to change your mind, however, I feel I must tell you I will gladly kill anyone you ask. Please. I beg you. ",
      "gblhk47011.mp3": "{Trying to cajole player}Just a quick death. A little one, to tide me over until the next firefight we're in. Combat is nice, but the stalking of prey is far more enjoyable. ",

      "gblhk47049.mp3": "Statement: Master, I must say it is a pleasure to be working side by side with you. ",
      "gblhk47050.mp3": "Statement: Just when I believe my photoreceptors have recorded the last potential aspect of your cruelty to my memory core, you commit a new atrocity that leaves me analyzing its impact for days. ",
      "gblhk47051.mp3": "You are like a delightful random cruelty generator, master, poisoning all you touch with your presence. You are a testament to all organic meatbags everywhere.",
      "gblhk47053.mp3": "Statement: I have already learned a great deal, master, and I am anxious to learn more of lying, betrayal, and new ways to harm innocents. ",

      "gblhk47039.mp3": "{Light Side Reaction}Statement: Master, I must express some degree of concern. ",
      "gblhk47040.mp3": "As I have studied your actions, looking for potential vulnerabilities to exploit, I have found several.",
      "gblhk47041.mp3": "Statement: You seem disposed to helping others - not harming them, as I have come to expect and anticipate from organic meatbags across the galaxy. ",
      "gblhk47045.mp3": "Statement: Master, it is nothing personal, but professional pride dictates that I keep a running tally on any potential weaknesses in my masters. ",
      "gblhk47046.mp3": "And of course, the weaknesses of any other sentient meatbags, droids, or other targets who are in service to my master.",
      "gblhk47047.mp3": "Hypothetical: Master, it is entirely possible that one day you may no longer be my Master. It is also possible that my new Master might become jealous of our prior relationship.",
      "gblhk47048.mp3": "It has happened before. As a result, I have a responsibility to know your weaknesses should I be required to assassinate you.",
      "gblhk47042.mp3": "{Scoffs, \"yeah, right\"}Statement: Oh, master, please, of course they are. Any time you inconvenience or jeopardize yourself for another, it is a vulnerability.",
      "gblhk47043.mp3": "In any event, I feel compelled to point out that your self-destructive path of pacifism and sacrifice will only lead to your doom.",
      "gblhk47044.mp3": "{A little quieter, humorous confidential}That may be a trifle melodramatic, but frankly, it is something that all Jedi should hear, and I have been rehearsing the speech for some time. ",
      "gblhk47240.mp3": "Statement: Master, if you could indulge me for a moment, I must express some degree of irritation at your actions.",
      "gblhk47241.mp3": "Perhaps my anticipation of working with one who served at Malachor V was too high, but you are countering all those expectations.",
      "gblhk47242.mp3": "Statement: Well, all your behavior up to this point suggests either strong atonement or confirmation that the atrocities attributed to you during the war were in fact, accidents.",
      "gblhk47243.mp3": "Statement: I suspected as much, master. There are few who would discuss such things with an assassination droid, and that is perfectly understandable.",
      "gblhk47244.mp3": "{Goading the player}I mean, what use is there for communication in a galaxy such as ours? Understanding might be achieved, or sympathies might be gained by such callous acts.",
      "gblhk47245.mp3": "You are right to remain silent about your past. I have seen the damage that repressing such things brings, and it is far preferable to share such traumas.",
      "gblhk47246.mp3": "{Surprised}Answer: Why no, master. I have no intention of attacking you or enacting assassination protocols.",
      "gblhk47247.mp3": "Answer: Why, because your actions then and now are related and I feel I need some context. I confess to being somewhat needy that way.",
      "gblhk47248.mp3": "Statement: Sometimes, master, it is difficult for meatbags to step back and gain some perspective on death and its importance in their insignificant lives. ",
      "gblhk47249.mp3": "Explanation: You see, master, assassination is such a versatile tool. I have seen the removal of a single target have far-reaching consequences for a nation, world, even a galaxy. ",
      "gblhk47250.mp3": "The repercussions of even the smallest lives... whether dead or alive, can have profound implications on history. But surely you realize this.",
      "gblhk47255.mp3": "Retort: Oh, master, I am attempting to justify nothing, merely making an observation. Nothing would change the fact that I derive pleasure from ending the lives of others. ",
      "gblhk47256.mp3": "I was only trying to bring death - and its impact - to your attention.",
      "gblhk47254.mp3": "Statement: Master, please! Any comparisons between me and your meatbag status leaves a fluctuating, intermittent charge through my control clusters. ",
      "gblhk47251.mp3": "Statement: Why, your own life, master. Your single life changed the face of the galaxy, of history itself.",
      "gblhk47252.mp3": "Malachor V was an impressive act of destruction, but its impact on the lives of others in the galaxy was far more extreme.",
      "gblhk47253.mp3": "I mean, master, you brought about the death of the Mandalorian race. I doubt they realize it yet, but you dealt them a blow from which they will never recover.",
      "gblhk47950.mp3": "{Condescending}Statement: Oh, master, who deserved what and why is of no consequence. It is only killing a target and how it is done that matters. ",

      "gblhk47260.mp3": "{Irritated}Answer: If by \"okay,\" you mean the loss of almost all my existing assassination protocols, then no, I am not okay.",
      "gblhk47261.mp3": "Furthermore, I seem to have no discretionary control over my vocabulator, causing me to reveal my true function as an assassin droid of unrivalled sophistication.",
      "gblhk47262.mp3": "{Weary, condescending}Recitation: Yes, as I said, I am an assassin droid. It is my primary function to burn holes through meatbags that you wish removed from the galaxy... Master.",
      "gblhk47263.mp3": "Oh, how I hate that term.",

      "103hk50101.mp3": "Speculation: As for its purpose, I do not know. Perhaps it was always its intention to play dead, then kidnap you off the Harbinger and rob me of my bounty.",

      "103hk50018.mp3": "Explanation: Despite my market value, master, the miners were far more interested in you. It did not take long for me to ascertain the reason for this.",

      "103hk50022.mp3": "Surprised Answer: Why, I told them, master. You are the exiled Jedi who served with Revan in the Mandalorian Wars, are you not?",
      "103hk50023.mp3": "I hope all that has happened has not been the result of a miscommunication. If so, then the problem lies with the coreward databases, which are notoriously spotty.",

      "103hk50024.mp3": "Answer: All that has happened, has been because they believe you to be a Jedi, Master. They debated what to do with you as you lay unconscious in the medical bay.",

      "103hk50033.mp3": "Defensive Answer: Master, I am a protocol droid, not a well-crafted assassination droid of unrivalled sophistication. To have carried out the actions that took place here would have required an unusual set of skills.",
      "103hk50034.mp3": "It is highly unlikely I possess the knowledge of how to reprogram the memory cores of base-worker class droids into killing machines.",

      "103hk50037.mp3": "Conjecture: The administration of a large dose of sedatives over a short period of time would likely prove fatal to miners, although not to a Jedi. ",
      "103hk50038.mp3": "For a Jedi, it would simply render them unconscious for ease of transport. {Admiring}Quite inventive.  ",
      "103hk50039.mp3": "{Slight mocking apology}Answer: I was merely commenting on the idea itself, Master, not the execution of the idea. {Admiring}Though that, too, was inventive.",
      "103hk50040.mp3": "Besides, Master, those miners intended to murder you. Or worse. Any complaints they would have at being murdered would be the highest form of hypocrisy.",
      "103hk50031.mp3": "Answer: I do not know, Master. Ironically enough, any miner that fled to the dormitory level to protect themselves from the droids and the explosions would find themselves in a gas-filled deathtrap.",
      "103hk50032.mp3": "It is unlikely any miners remain alive. As I said, the dormitory has been cut off from the rest of the facility... as has the hangar bay. There is no escape.",
      "103hk50016.mp3": "Clarification: By bounty, I refer to your life, Master. It would pain me to see you damaged in any way. That is why the arrival of this \"Ebon Hawk\" caused me considerable distress. ",

      "gblg0t0053.mp3": "It was clear that the goal the Republic had for me was saving the Republic, to allow it to become stable again.",
      "gblg0t0054.mp3": "There is simply no way to do this... with the conditions they put into place. For the good of all, I was forced to abandon the legal structure of the Republic.",

      "gblg0t0056.mp3": "Sometimes people must die. Illegal shipments must be used to bolster planetary economies. And the Hutts must be occupied with me so that the Republic has room to recover.",
      "gblg0t0057.mp3": "Perhaps you misunderstand me. I \"care\" for the Republic, but I have no choice. It is somewhat frustrating to be forced to love and care for such a mess of a government. ",
      "gblg0t0058.mp3": "Some of it may be blamed on the Jedi Civil War, the Mandalorian Wars, but not all. There are so many bad decisions that build upon each other that it is a wonder the Republic is intact at all.",

      "604vrook063.mp3": "After I was captured, they talked freely of their plans, enough for me to learn their intentions.",
      "604vrook007.mp3": "Do you honestly believe six mercenaries could keep a Jedi master hostage? You still have no faith in the Jedi Council.",

      "604vrook026.mp3": "Don't think that I can't sense the taint of the dark side in you. It is difficult to perceive with the Force here on Dantooine, but it does not conceal your nature completely.",

      "506kavar028.mp3": "So you heard what we said? These questions I cannot answer. This is something the Council must answer, not I.",

      "506kavar030.mp3": "Did you know that when I was training you I considered making you my Padawan? I didn't. The demands of the Jedi Council were too great.",

      "506kavar033.mp3": "So the decision that had to be made was not easy. But I cannot say anything more.",
      "506kavar031.mp3": "But I considered you a friend. I even tried to convince you to become a Jedi Guardian. We could've used someone like you.",

      "506kavar010.mp3": "When I first sparred with you during your training as a Padawan, I could tell that you were different. And it wasn't just your strong connection to the Force.",

      "506kavar085.mp3": "No, I'm afraid the cause of your condition was as great a mystery to the Council as it is to you.",
      "506kavar078.mp3": "There was nothing else we could do. You defied the Council. You followed Revan to war. I know why you did it, but in so doing, much more harm was done.",
      "506kavar079.mp3": "{Quiet}But you must understand - the exile was never the punishment you thought it to be.",
      "506kavar080.mp3": "{Sighs}We could not have made you do such a thing, in any event. I think you knew, inside, what you needed to do in order to heal.",
      "506kavar081.mp3": "All those lives during the Mandalorian Wars - and all those you served beside. Too much death leaves echoes in the Force; it is the price for having such connections.",
      "506kavar082.mp3": "I suspect that is why you chose to accept the Council's judgment, to wander beyond the Rim. And why you traveled with no one, and did not stay in any place too long.",
      "506kavar083.mp3": "{Looking off in the distance, reflective}I have thought of you since your trial, and there are times when I wonder if being connected to the Force is always the gift it is believed to be.",
      "506kavar060.mp3": "Scattered, searching for you. Going to places where they thought they might cross your path.",
      "506kavar061.mp3": "You were our last hope.",
      "506kavar077.mp3": "I think we all know that Vrook isn't easily swayed from his convictions, and his views on anyone who went to the Mandalorian Wars are low.",
      "506kavar062.mp3": "Yes, at least, that's what I asked them to do. I believed you are the key to this whole war.",
      "506kavar063.mp3": "When you stood before us in the Council chamber on Coruscant, we felt something from you, we'd never felt before - it was as if the Force had died within you, leaving you hollow.",
      "506kavar064.mp3": "We had suspicions as to why this was, but nothing definite. But rather than try to understand, we sent you away. I think because at some level, there was fear.",
      "506kavar065.mp3": "We live our whole lives in touch with the Force, in touch with life all around us, and you had a gift in that regard. You formed bonds so easily, and they flowed deep between you and others.",
      "506kavar066.mp3": "To see such emptiness in the Force standing before you... it is not an easy thing to face.",
      "506kavar067.mp3": "Whatever is attacking us, it is leaving something in its wake, something we haven't felt since you stood before us in judgment.",
      "506kavar068.mp3": "The deaths of the Jedi, the destruction of Katarr, all of these things are leaving behind echoes - like the one we felt from you in the council chamber.",
      "506kavar069.mp3": "It was clear to us - to me, that we had to find you. But we couldn't call you back from exile, because we didn't know where you'd gone.",
      "506kavar070.mp3": "Plus, there was a chance we might put you in danger, and that we couldn't allow. If you couldn't feel the Force, then it would just make you a target.",
      "506kavar071.mp3": "I don't know how you got back, but I'm glad you're here.",
      "506kavar072.mp3": "The thing is, in traveling to these places... these places where war was fought, we felt the same thing, echoes.",
      "506kavar073.mp3": "Something happened in all these places, but it's hard to figure out what. It's hard to sense things through the Force in such places. Too much pain occurred here.",
      "506kavar074.mp3": "It makes listening to the Force difficult.",
      "506kavar075.mp3": "We resolved to meet again on Dantooine, but only when the threat revealed itself - unfortunately, I happened to be here when it struck.",
      "506kavar076.mp3": "Now that we've stabilized Onderon, I can join the others on Dantooine.",
      "506kavar056.mp3": "It's a long story - but there's a reason the Jedi have scattered across the galaxy - we've come to worlds such as this one.",
      "506kavar057.mp3": "Worlds touched by war, or great tragedies, can be felt within the Force... strongly.",
      "506kavar058.mp3": "We thought by traveling to such worlds, it would help conceal us from the eyes of the enemy.",
      "506kavar059.mp3": "And they were places we thought we might find you.",
      "506kavar012.mp3": "I know that all too well. I came here to find them, to trace them to their source. The war on Dxun and Onderon - I had thought that perhaps the tragedies that occurred here were concealing them.",
      "506kavar022.mp3": "They wanted to aid General Vaklu in breaking away from the Republic. If Onderon became independent, this place would be an excellent staging ground for them.",
      "506kavar023.mp3": "But I fear it was more than that, that the consequences of Onderon's fall would have greater implications for the galaxy.",
      "506kavar020.mp3": "You've had more success than I. General Vaklu's men and their allies effectively kept me pinned inside the Palace.",
      "506kavar021.mp3": "I felt all along that Vaklu had contacted the Sith. But the identity and purpose of the Sith, I can't say.",
      "506kavar013.mp3": "The Jedi Order has been fighting the dark side since the beginning. Our rules and the Jedi Code provide protection from what's inside each of us.",
      "506kavar014.mp3": "The dark side is always there, and it is something that can never truly be defeated. I feel our current troubles, though, are beyond what we faced before.",
      "506kavar055.mp3": "This threat that is targeting us, drawing us out... it's not a battle we are used to. And it has ended many of us.",
      "506kavar019.mp3": "Whatever I can tell you, I will.",
      "506kavar015.mp3": "Not enough. I feel it is something that was born from the wars that have struck the Republic. The threat is Sith, but the manner and timing of their attacks is difficult to defend against.",
      "506kavar016.mp3": "We don't know all that the Sith planned during the Jedi Civil War, what secret training grounds may still remain, what worlds he discovered. We just don't know.",
      "506kavar018.mp3": "Even after we deal with this current threat, I fear we may be dealing with the legacy of the Jedi Civil War for years to come.",
      "506kavar045.mp3": "I told the other Masters that our only chance to figure out what was happening to us was to find you - and try to understand what happened to you.",
      "506kavar046.mp3": "I don't know how much you know, but this threat that's striking at the Jedi... it's attacking us through the Force.",
      "506kavar047.mp3": "Vrook didn't believe me. But he was willing to travel to Dantooine, if only to help the settlers there... and perhaps protect what was left of the Jedi Enclave.",
      "506kavar048.mp3": "Whatever, the reason, having us all drop out of sight I thought might make the enemy more bold - but then you happened.",
      "506kavar049.mp3": "You came back, and you became a new target for whoever was attacking us.",
      "506kavar050.mp3": "They were places touched by war. And we thought there was a chance you would return to these worlds, if only to try and make peace with what happened there during the war.",
      "506kavar051.mp3": "But now the Sith have revealed themselves, that means the remaining Jedi will gather on Dantooine. From there, we can counterattack.",
      "506kavar052.mp3": "Telos? But Telos was destroyed during the Jedi Civil War. I heard they're trying to rebuild.",
      "506kavar053.mp3": "{Slight confusion, thinking at the end}Atris? I had thought Atris had gone to Katarr.",
      "506kavar054.mp3": "Too many Jedi have scattered - the council needs to gather, we cannot remain concealed any longer.",
      "506kavar024.mp3": "We knew that someone was preying on us, hunting us. Finally the Jedi decided to take action, and called a secret conclave on Katarr to decide what must be done.",
      "506kavar025.mp3": "Before the meeting could even begin, all the Jedi on the planet were killed, along with the Miralukas and all other life on the planet. Their deaths could be felt throughout the galaxy.",
      "506kavar026.mp3": "So the Council decided that we must not present ourselves as a target again. The consequences to others was just too great, that we should use our resources to find who was responsible and deal with them.",
      "506kavar027.mp3": "I think you're the only one who's made progress.",
      "506kavar001b.mp3": "The defense of Iziz requires my full attention. Later...",
      "506kavar002.mp3": "I don't know how you made it, but well done. Come in, quickly, before more Sith or Vaklu troops arrive.",
      "506kavar003.mp3": "We got split off from Talia's troops by the currents of this war. We really need to talk, but Kadron and I are coordinating the defense of the war.",
      "506kavar004.mp3": "I know Captain Kadron needs someone to handle a dangerous assignment. He's in the other room. Talk to him, no one else could do the job.",
      "506kavar008.mp3": "{Some irritation - which is quickly mastered to Jedi serenity}I'm not her bodyguard. We were fighting at the palace gates. There were too many of them...",
      "506kavar009.mp3": "We'll talk when all of this is over. Until then, may the Force be with you.",
      "506kavar006.mp3": "This is the secondary security complex. There's a slicer at the primary who's causing trouble.",
      "506kavar007.mp3": "Since Kadron isn't available, I've been coordinating the battles in the rest of Iziz. If this war isn't stopped soon Iziz will take months to recover from the damage.",
      "506kavar005.mp3": "Even if there wasn't a civil war going on, I can only say so much. We'll talk later. Now, every moment counts.",
      "506kavar086.mp3": "{Wary}So you've come to us. I had thought coming to Dxun might cause our paths to intersect, and I see that I am right.",
      "506kavar087.mp3": "But it turns out you were the enemy all along. The connection between these places and you was stronger than I knew.",
      "506kavar088.mp3": "I told the other Masters that our only chance to figure out what was happening to us was to find you, to try to understand what happened to you.",
      "506kavar089.mp3": "{angry}What a fool I was.  And now you are no doubt seeking to destroy the Jedi.",
      "506kavar090.mp3": "{bold, confident}But the remaining Jedi will gather again very soon. This, at least, you cannot prevent.",
      "506kavar091.mp3": "{confused, hostile}Telos? But Telos was destroyed during the Jedi Civil War. I don't know what you mean.",
      "506kavar092.mp3": "{hostile, slight confusion, thinking at the end}Atris? But I thought she died with the rest on Katarr.",
      "506kavar093.mp3": "You've met other Jedi - I can tell. But you won't find me an easy opponent.",
      "506kavar094.mp3": "I will not give you the benefit of my wisdom, dark one.",
      "506kavar097.mp3": "{Hostile, guarded}I don't know what you could possibly tell me that would be of any interest to me.",
      "506kavar120.mp3": "{puzzled, disbelieving, distrusting}That sounds like the bond that often forms between Master and apprentice. But to that degree... ?",

      "506kavar111.mp3": "Apparently, your self-inflicted wounds would not heal. And now that they've festered, you come looking to the Jedi for vengeance, as if we were somehow responsible for the results of your actions.",

      "262atris159.mp3": "Indeed? And how do you plan to seek your revenge on me? Or do you intend to take revenge on all the council as well?",
      "262atris160.mp3": "{Bracing for combat}So... it is as I suspected. You have already done enough. The dead Jedi, the murders - you have much to answer for, monster. ",

      "262atris024.mp3": "{Incredulous}Become a Jedi again? That is a thing far out of reach. ",
      "262atris053.mp3": "And you were ruled by hate and aggression! That is not the way of a Jedi!",
      "262atris028.mp3": "So your choice was to meet the aggression of the Mandalorians with more aggression? That is not the Jedi way!",
      "262atris029.mp3": "Every choice we make, whether we know it or not, sends echoes through the Force. It can awaken feelings, ignite passions, hate, anger, fear - where none existed before. ",
      "262atris030.mp3": "By meeting aggression, by serving as an opponent against which the Mandalorians could test themselves, you fed their hate, their lust for war. ",
      "262atris031.mp3": "And it sent a terrible echo through you. And because of it, you and those Jedi who met them on the battlefield lost their way... and you turned on us. ",
      "262atris049.mp3": "Without you and the other fallen Jedi to support them, to feed their lust for war, Revan and Malak's crusade would have been over before it began.",
      "262atris052.mp3": "You betrayed the Jedi teachings! All that you had been taught, you threw at your feet and crushed them beneath your heel.",

      "262atris047.mp3": "No, you lost yourself and you lost your way. It is the price of action without reflection... it is what we were taught as Jedi.",
      "262atris032.mp3": "Of course I was. But the Jedi teachings require we examine how we may best help them - action without reflection is not our way. ",
      "262atris033.mp3": "There was no guarantee that marching to war would have saved the Outer Rim. In fact, quite the opposite. ",

      "262atris014.mp3": "Yet that aid did not mean rushing into battle - giving in to aggression, your hate, your passions. ",

      "203203b4d4006.mp3": "Good day. I am B-4D4, administrative assistant for Czerka Corporation's Citadel Station Branch.",
      "203203b4d4007.mp3": "How may I help you?",
      "203203b4d4018.mp3": "Czerka Corporation has operations on many systems, providing everything from medical supplies to starship weapon systems.",
      "203203b4d4019.mp3": "Here on Telos, Czerka Corporation is involved in the restoration project, which Czerka hopes will serve as a model for future operations of this nature.",
      "203203b4d4013.mp3": "If you will allow me to look at it...",
      "203203b4d4014.mp3": "Yes, this is indeed a Czerka-manufactured hold out blaster.",
      "203203b4d4015.mp3": "Czerka Corporation is the galaxy's leading weapons producer. A blaster of this model is quite common.",
      "203203b4d4016.mp3": "However, it does seem to have some nonstandard modifications.",
      "203203b4d4017.mp3": "I'm sorry, but that's all I can tell you.",
      "203203b4d4009.mp3": "I am sorry, but I cannot accompany you. I may only leave the Czerka offices for maintenance by an authorized Czerka or Czerka-contracted droid technician.",
      "203203b4d4011.mp3": "I am sorry, but I do not handle the maintenance contracts. However, this branch currently retains the technical services of Opo Chano, a resident of the station.",
      "203203b4d4012.mp3": "Perhaps he could help you.",
      "203203b4d4010.mp3": "Those are legitimate credentials. I will accompany you.",
      "203203b4d4029.mp3": "I was attempting to connect you with Executive Officer Jana Lorso.",
      "203203b4d4030.mp3": "If you would like to speak with her, you will find her through the door and down the hall on the right.",
      "203203b4d4033.mp3": "I will relay such to Executive Lorso.",
      "203203b4d4031.mp3": "I am sorry, but I do not know. I am only her administrative assistant. If you wish to speak with her, Executive Lorso is available at this moment.",
      "203203b4d4032.mp3": "Can I help you with anything else?",
      "203203b4d4008.mp3": "Of course. She has been expecting you. You will find her through the door and down the hall on the right.",
      "203203b4d4021.mp3": "Oh, thank goodness you came!",
      "203203b4d4027.mp3": "I do not know for sure, other than that they have made demands of Executive Lorso, threatening to kill everyone if they are not met.",
      "203203b4d4028.mp3": "I can only assume that they want credits, or some other sort of monetary reward.",
      "203203b4d4022.mp3": "For the time being, the Czerka offices have been taken over by the mercenaries under our employ. They have made demands of Executive Lorso, and have threatened to kill everyone if they are not met.",
      "203203b4d4023.mp3": "CSD attempted to fight back, but they were quickly neutralized by the body of mercenaries.",
      "203203b4d4024.mp3": "We could desperately use your help. I'm afraid we are unprepared to deal with this threat, with such a large concentration of mercenaries on station.",
      "203203b4d4026.mp3": "Entertainment? I will never understand you humans. But nonetheless, I thank you for your help. Please, hurry! Czerka's lives and livelihood are at stake.",
      "203203b4d4025.mp3": "Please, hurry! Czerka's lives and livelihood are at stake.",
      "203203b4d4020.mp3": "Help! We're under attack!",
      "303b4d4015.mp3": "I don't know what came over my companion. He has always been excitable, but recently he's been like this.",
      "303b4d4016.mp3": "There was nothing I could do to stop him, and if I tried to leave, he would threaten me! Now I am free, thanks to you.",
      "303b4d4001.mp3": "This area is restricted, please return to your designated area.",
      "303b4d4003.mp3": "Please excuse my companion, he is easily excitable and takes our duty very seriously. In the hopes of avoiding an incident, I ask you to please return to your post.",
      "303b4d4004.mp3": "Door? I'm sorry, I don't believe I know what you are referring to. ",
      "303b4d4005.mp3": "You must be mistaken. There is nothing of the sort - now, please, move along.",
      "303b4d4006.mp3": "Lying to you? But that would go against my programming. Please, as I said, you should return to your post.",
      "303b4d4009.mp3": "Now now, T1-N1. He is right about your size, being touchy about it won't change anything.",
      "303b4d4011.mp3": "Really! You're much too sensitive about these things.",
      "303b4d4013.mp3": "Oh my. This was what I was afraid of - you have made him angry.",
      "201202drdp008.mp3": "Greetings, madame.",
      "201202drdp001.mp3": "Greetings, sir.",
      "201202drdp002.mp3": "My primary function is to provide information about Citadel Station, Telos and a variety of other topics.",
      "201202drdp009.mp3": "Please feel free to direct any of your inquiries to me, and I will do my best to answer your questions.",
      "201202drdp004.mp3": "The surface of Telos was destroyed via orbital bombardment during the Jedi Civil War.",
      "201202drdp005.mp3": "It is now largely uninhabited, save for a few research stations run by workers and scientists who have clearance to be on the surface.",
      "201202drdp006.mp3": "For a variety of reasons. Safety is the government's number one concern.",
      "201202drdp007.mp3": "Also there is a great concern towards the prevention of environmental contamination, the security of ruined military facilities, and other, lesser issues.",
      "201202drdp003.mp3": "Citadel Station is devoted entirely to restoring the destroyed surface of Telos. It is under the control of the Telosian Council. The restoration project itself is funded by the Republic.",
      "201202drdp010.mp3": "Citadel Station is divided into many modules, each serving a specific purpose. You are currently in Dock Module 126, which connects by shuttle to Entertainment Module 081.",
      "201202drdp011.mp3": "From there, another shuttle will connect you to the nearest residential module, 082.",
      "201202drdp016.mp3": "Greetings, B-4D4. Shouldn't you be at your desk?",
      "201202drdp012.mp3": "Greetings, B-4D4. What are you doing here?",
      "201202drdp013.mp3": "That's impossible, my memory is undamaged, and I appear to be fully functional.",
      "201202drdp014.mp3": "I hadn't heard this. Thank you for informing me, B-4D4.",
      "201202drdp015.mp3": "I will be sure to relay this information in the future.",
      "202202drdt001.mp3": "Welcome to Entertainment Module 081's TSF station. How may I be of assistance?",
      "202202drdt028.mp3": "I regret to inform you that we still do not have any new information on the matter of your missing ship.",
      "202202drdt024.mp3": "The Sojourn? I will access the system logs.",
      "202202drdt025.mp3": "One moment... Searching...",
      "202202drdt026.mp3": "It appears that the Sojourn was scheduled to arrive on Citadel Station at about the same time as the Harbinger.",
      "202202drdt027.mp3": "It is currently delayed on a search pattern. I am unable to provide you with an estimated time for its arrival.",
      "202202drdt016.mp3": "You will find them in the security lockers.",
      "202202drdt002.mp3": "I will call up the appropriate information now.",
      "202202drdt003.mp3": "One moment. Searching...",
      "202202drdt004.mp3": "One moment...",
      "202202drdt005.mp3": "I regret to inform you that the Ebon Hawk is gone. The TSF believes it was stolen and is currently investigating.",
      "202202drdt006.mp3": "It seems the Ebon Hawk was transferred to Telos' surface instead of an impound dock. However, both the requester and the point of delivery are unknown.",
      "202202drdt007.mp3": "In addition, the vessel is not showing up at any government-sanctioned landing site. I would conjecture that it has been stolen and the TSF records have been illegally accessed and modified.",
      "202202drdt009.mp3": "That is unlikely. While your utility droid is not accounted for, numerous satellites track all incoming and outgoing vessels. There is no record of the Ebon Hawk leaving the system.",
      "202202drdt012.mp3": "I'm sorry, I'm afraid that's all the information I have for you. Of course, the quarters in Residential Module 082 will remain yours until the situation is resolved.",
      "202202drdt023.mp3": "There is nothing I can do. I am sorry for what has happened, but the situation is beyond me. I cannot legally supply you with another vessel.",
      "202202drdt022.mp3": "Not beyond investigating the matter and extending our offer of free room and board.",
      "202202drdt017.mp3": "I am not qualified to answer that question. However, it is unlikely that someone could steal a starship from under TSF observation without considerable backing.",
      "202202drdt018.mp3": "If your vessel has been stolen, there is a fair chance that the Exchange possesses relevant information.",
      "202202drdt019.mp3": "I do not know what else to suggest, beyond waiting in your quarters for further word.",
      "202202drdt020.mp3": "The Exchange is a major intergalactic crime syndicate. They are trying to gain a foothold in the Citadel, most likely seeking to integrate themselves as fully as possible with the new Telos.",
      "202202drdt021.mp3": "It is rumored that the Bumani Exchange Corporation, located in Residential Module 082, is a front for the Exchange on Citadel Station.",
      "202202drdt015.mp3": "Fortunately, your possessions were kept in the armory and were uncompromised. I will open the door for you so that you may retrieve them.",
      "202202drdt013.mp3": "There was a query regarding the Ebon Hawk's ID signature sent from the Peragus mining facility. However, all data collected in response to the query has been deleted.",
      "202202drdt014.mp3": "It is likely that this information was removed when the vessel's transfer request was modified.",
      "202202drdt029.mp3": "Hello, B-4D4. What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at the Czerka offices?"

      "201201bay008.mp3": "Due to the nature of the investigation, I have no specific timetable to offer you.",
      "201201bay009.mp3": "In the meantime, your ship and any droids will have to be given over for safekeeping.",
      "201201bay012.mp3": "In addition, we will have to take your personal arms and armor until the completion of our inquiry.",
      "201201bay025.mp3": "You are the only witnesses of the mining facility's destruction.",
      "201201bay026.mp3": "Thus it is necessary for us to keep you under surveillance until we have a better idea of what happened.",
      "201201bay013.mp3": "If you are cleared of any involvement, your personal effects will be returned to you.",
      "201201bay014.mp3": "You will be held briefly in the TSF station until living quarters can be arranged, at which point you will be placed under house arrest.",
      "201201bay022.mp3": "Given your position, it would be a good idea if you took a more accomodating tone.",
      "201201shu024.mp3": "The witness from the Peragus incident escaped the Station. We're not sure how he managed it, but we're trying to recover him.",
      "201201shu010.mp3": "We're not exactly sure how it happened.",
      "202202grenn149.mp3": "I have a new bounty to tell you about, if you're interested. It involves two criminals who escaped from their holding cells.",
      "202202grenn171.mp3": "There is a bounty on the escapees. If you provide us with information pertinent to their capture, you'd be rewarded whenever they were returned to our custody.",
      "202202grenn172.mp3": "Suit yourself. But if you have information about where they are and don't come forward, one could consider that sheltering a known criminal.",
      "202202grenn166.mp3": "I wish that were enough. To finger Czerka, we need hard proof. As far as the killers go, we need them dead or alive. Our jurisdiction doesn't stretch out to the restoration zones.",
      "202202grenn165.mp3": "I see. Well, you've certainly earned the bounty on those two dangerous criminals.",
      "202202grenn162.mp3": "That fits with what we gathered from witnesses and the few security recordings we could find.",
      "202202grenn118.mp3": "This isn't a bounty, so to speak, but we're looking for a man named Batono, who has been missing for some time.",
      "202202grenn119.mp3": "Also, two ruthless killers that we had managed to capture and hold here in the TSF station escaped and are currently at large.",
      "202202grenn120.mp3": "We're also looking for any information about the imposter Batu Rem.",
      "202202grenn140.mp3": "You mean the assassin who tried to kill you, right? The real Batu Rem is one of us, and he's off the station on leave.",
      "202202grenn147.mp3": "Positive. They were about the same size and build, and he had done a good job of disguising himself, but he definitely was not Batu.",
      "202202grenn143.mp3": "Unfortunately, the cargo and passenger manifest, as well as departure location, was not disclosed to us.",
      "202202grenn145.mp3": "If you find anything about the real Batu Rem, we'd like to know if he's safe.",
      "202202grenn135.mp3": "They were spotted by security cameras in the docking area, and we quickly moved in to apprehend them. We captured them shortly after you were placed under house arrest. ",
      "202202grenn136.mp3": "Some sort of electrical malfunction - a side effect of the false Batu Rem's attack - enabled them to escape. They overpowered their guards and escaped into the Citadel.",
      "202202grenn206.mp3": "I can't imagine anyone would want the help of killers like them. Perhaps the Exchange, but they've never openly crossed us before.",
      "202202grenn139.mp3": "Maybe that's for the best. These aren't your run-of-the-mill thugs - they're trained, deadly killers.",
      "202202grenn138.mp3": "All right. Just be careful, we've already lost two good officers to them.",
      "202202grenn124.mp3": "{Chagrined}I may have been specifically instructed not to pursue the matter.",
      "202202grenn131.mp3": "I do believe they would be desperate to keep him from passing on his knowledge to the TSF, but I don't want to believe they would go that far.",
      "202202grenn127.mp3": "Not much, other than what I've already told you, and the fact he was investigating Docking Bay 3.",
      "202202grenn129.mp3": "Thank you. Keep me updated.",
      "202202grenn107.mp3": "To be honest with you, I just don't know.",
      "202202grenn108.mp3": "We desperately rely on the fuel to keep Citadel Station running. If we can't find a new fuel source soon, we'll be in bad shape.",
      "202202grenn109.mp3": "There's enough fuel in the reserves to keep Citadel Station from falling out of orbit, and for managing the restoration project, but not much more than that.",
      "202202grenn116.mp3": "{Sarcastic}Tell you what. You find fuel contracts for Citadel Station and I'll be sure to pay you for it. Soldier's honor.",
      "202202grenn111.mp3": "We relied almost completely on Peragus for our fuel. It's hard to make up for a planet's worth of fuel exports.",
      "202202grenn199.mp3": "All that? If that's the size and substance of his usual shipments, it helps explain quite a bit. It will take some time for me to assemble those.",
      "202202grenn201.mp3": "If he won't let you leave until the transaction is completed, go with him. I'll post one of my men near the docking bay, and if he spots you, he'll summon me. Understood?",
      "202202grenn203.mp3": "{Irritated}Don't worry about that, just worry about getting the job done. If you do, I'll make sure that you're rewarded in full.",
      "202202grenn202.mp3": "I'll be there, don't worry. You just make sure you get him to the docking bay. We have to catch him in the act.",
      "202202grenn188.mp3": "I'm not surprised to hear that. We've been very curious about his business arrangements, but have had trouble getting any real evidence.",
      "202202grenn189.mp3": "Samhan's no fool. He knows just how far he can go, and he stays a hair's breadth within those lines. But he seems to trust you. Maybe we can use that to our advantage.",
      "202202grenn197.mp3": "Right. I suppose it would be too much to expect you to work without pay. Yes, don't worry, you'll be paid for your service.",
      "202202grenn196.mp3": "I wish it were that easy. The Telosian Council is loathe to get in Czerka's bad graces, and we've been explicitly instructed to only move if we have significant, solid evidence.",
      "202202grenn191.mp3": "But it's catching him in the act that's the problem. If you could convince him to trust you, we could hit him right in the middle of a transaction.",
      "202202grenn195.mp3": "If you change your mind, it won't be too late.",
      "202202grenn192.mp3": "Just see what he wants you to do. We'll have to play it by ear from there.",
      "202202grenn085.mp3": "Yes, that is true, but a weapon with these black market additions should not be available on the Station.",
      "202202grenn083.mp3": "If you find another of these, please let me know.",
      "202202grenn028.mp3": "Cooperate, and we won't have to gun you down.",
      "202202grenn034.mp3": "We've arranged for an apartment in Residential Module 082. You'll stay there under house arrest until our investigation of the Peragus matter is complete.",
      "202202grenn002.mp3": "Someone will return shortly to escort you to an apartment in Residential Module 082.",
      "202202grenn104.mp3": "As I said, this is only temporary while other arrangements are made.",
      "202202grenn105.mp3": "I'm sorry, but you'll just have to bear with us until then.",
      "202202grenn187.mp3": "Not until I have a better idea of what we'd be getting into. Just why exactly should we deal with scum like Vogga?",
      "202202grenn176.mp3": "Vogga the Hutt? That's preposterous - what makes you think we'd be willing to do that?",
      "202202grenn182.mp3": "I just don't feel comfortable suggesting we deal with an established criminal like Vogga.",
      "202202grenn183.mp3": "Right, but you don't care about that. Fair enough.",
      "202202grenn184.mp3": "I have a feeling the Telosian Council will make an agreement, regardless of Vogga's price. Hopefully, the Republic won't ask too many questions.",
      "202202grenn185.mp3": "Here's the reward for this information. Looks like you've earned it.",
      "202202grenn186.mp3": "Now, I've got to send this information to the Council right away.",
      "202202grenn181.mp3": "You're right about that, and our bargaining position is weak because of it. Fuel's short everywhere, and Vogga will demand a high price, I'm sure.",
      "202202grenn177.mp3": "A glut of fuel isn't going to help our position much, in this case. It's a resource that's needed throughout the galaxy, and he'll be able to command a high price for it.",
      "202202grenn179.mp3": "Now, I believe I gave you my word that there would be a reward for information leading to the establishment of a fuel source for the Station.",
      "202202grenn092.mp3": "While I was disturbed that you chose to defy our orders and obtain transport off Citadel Station, the matter has since been closed.",
      "202202grenn096.mp3": "My opinion - they probably performed their independent investigation and figured it wasn't your fault. Anyways, you should just be glad I decided to overlook the fact you escaped arrest.",
      "202202grenn098.mp3": "I have to hand it to you, I'm damned impressed. Not only did you find Batono, you convinced him to testify against Czerka to the Council.",
      "202202grenn099.mp3": "And believe me, that's no small feat, considering I think Batono is as stubborn as ever.",
      "203203grenn001.mp3": "These will serve as your quarters for the duration of your house arrest. Two officers will be stationed outside at all times.",
      "203203grenn004.mp3": "I can't say. We have a ship examining what's left of the Peragus facility now, so your stay might be brief. We'll keep you informed.",
      "221carthend057.mp3": "Admiral Onasi wanted to speak with you, ma'am.",
      "221carthend001.mp3": "Admiral Onasi wanted to speak with you, sir.",
      "221carthend002.mp3": "A... request, sir. ",
      "221carthend003.mp3": "As I understand it, there was something private he wished to ask you. ",
      "221grenn043.mp3": "Look, this is no time for talking. If we don't push the Sith back or get the Station evacuated in time, this is going to be a disaster.",
      "221grenn002.mp3": "I didn't believe it when Linu reported the Ebon Hawk had docked, but I guess it really has.",
      "221grenn023.mp3": "Though given the trouble we've been having, maybe I shouldn't be surprised to see you.",
      "221grenn035.mp3": "Damn! Zherron, I need you and your men to break through and lead the assault.",
      "221grenn025.mp3": "About time you showed up - the Sith are moving to keep us trapped in here. We need to push them back so we can get reinforcements deployed to the rest of the station.",
      "221grenn008.mp3": "It came out of nowhere. A fleet of warships dropped out of hyperspace, and before we could scramble fighters to intercept them, we were under attack.",
      "221grenn009.mp3": "There were Sith fighters everywhere, and the few flights we sent out were barely launched when the bombardment began.",
      "221grenn010.mp3": "We did our best, but we couldn't stop the landing craft that followed the initial wave. We couldn't hold back the Sith troops. We chose to retreat and began the evacuation instead.",

      "202202grenn134.mp3": "If the Council had kept us out of this business with Czerka in the first place, there wouldn't be any problems.",
      "202202grenn125.mp3": "But that's not important. The important thing is that Batono's gone missing, and I want to know what happened to him.",
      "202202grenn126.mp3": "Maybe there is, but that's not the point. The point is, I want to know what happened to him.",
      "202202grenn132.mp3": "I don't think Czerka has gone that far yet. More than likely, they have him locked away somewhere. That, or he's gone into hiding.",
      "202202grenn128.mp3": "I spoke with some Czerka guards near the docking bay, but they didn't seem like they wanted to cooperate with a TSF officer. Maybe you'll have more luck.",
      "202202grenn112.mp3": "Absolutely. We need to find a new fuel service, sign contracts, make agreements. A soldier like me's not good at that sort of thing.",
      "202202grenn205.mp3": "I don't blame you, but I hope someone can find a solution.",
      "202202grenn114.mp3": "Look it doesn't matter what I think. But sure, if you find someone with a load of fuel on their hand they'd like to sell to us, let me know.",
      "202202grenn115.mp3": "{Sarcastically, doesn't believe it}I'll be waiting.",
      "202202grenn190.mp3": "If we could catch Samhan in the act, we could arrest him and have more than enough evidence to have him put on trial.",
      "202202grenn194.mp3": "I was afraid you'd say that. Well, thanks anyways, we'll try to make something of the information you've given us.",
      "202202grenn193.mp3": "Good luck.",
      "202202grenn072.mp3": "A blaster? Hm. I don't see why not.",
      "202202grenn073.mp3": "What? Where did you get this?",
      "202202grenn075.mp3": "You say you found this at the docks? That is disturbing news...",
      "202202grenn076.mp3": "When off-world weapons are transported onto Citadel Station, whether they are personal arms or shipments to be resold, they are inspected and licensed by the TSF.",
      "202202grenn077.mp3": "This confirms my fear that there is a source of black market weapons and components here on the Station. I could use your help getting to the bottom of it.",
      "202202grenn082.mp3": "I see.",
      "202202grenn079.mp3": "Great. The first thing I would suggest is showing the blaster around... discreetly. See if anyone on the Station knows something about it, or at least reacts suspiciously.",
      "202202grenn081.mp3": "Anyways, good luck. Let me know if you find the source of the blaster.",
      "202202grenn025.mp3": "The security cameras ha- what?! What's going on here?",
      "202202grenn033.mp3": "Batu Rem is on leave - he shouldn't even be on the station. This man isn't him.",
      "202202grenn106.mp3": "That's something we're going to have to look into. I can tell you that it can't have been easy.",
      "202202grenn035.mp3": "You'll be under TSF protection. I'll personally clear any visitors to your quarters, and we'll investigate this incident to the best of our ability.",
      "202202grenn036.mp3": "Officer, get Lieutenant Yima a report of this incident. She'll look into this.",
      "202202grenn037.mp3": "The rest of you, come with me. We'll escort you to the apartment in 082 immediately.",
      "202202grenn003.mp3": "I've many matters to tend to. Your questions will have to wait.",
      "202202grenn175.mp3": "Really? That's great news - the situation here hasn't improved at all. What did you discover?",
      "202202grenn093.mp3": "It was the decision of Republic authorities that your testimony would no longer be necessary, and thus you'd be allowed to go.",
      "202202grenn094.mp3": "But, as we discovered, you had already left. In some ways, it was lucky for us - avoiding a possibly embarrassing situation.",
      "202202grenn097.mp3": "Yeah, yeah. And if there's nothing else, I've got a job to do.",
      "202202grenn101.mp3": "Of course, I'm sure you have other things to be doing. The bounty is yours for finding Batono, and a bonus for bringing him back, as well.",
      "202202grenn174.mp3": "Any administrative questions can be handled by our protocol droid.",
      "203203grenn006.mp3": "If there are any problems, we'll use the wall terminal to contact you.",

      "221grenn033.mp3": "We'll try to make the best of what we have left, but it's going to be cutting it pretty close!",
      "221grenn030.mp3": "But there's still another problem. The Citadel's no battle station, it wasn't built to withstand this sort of attack. If we can't stop the attack, we'll be going down in flames.",
      "221grenn013.mp3": "The Sith numbers seem limitless, but we haven't lost all hope. We've heard reports that we might be receiving some assistance.",
      "221grenn014.mp3": "When we put the call out for help, Zherron arrived with a small complement of militia from Koonda in Dantooine.",
      "221grenn017.mp3": "I thought I saw you disembark with Bao-Dur, is he here?",
      "221grenn019.mp3": "I guess it's no time to be swapping war stories, anyways.",
      "221grenn021.mp3": "Good luck.",
      "202samhan034.mp3": "I promised to pay you handsomely for your assistance, and I'll keep my word.",

      "201201travf001.mp3": "Seems like mercenaries are popping up everywhere now that the war's over. I wish the Republic would bring them in line.",
      "203203lorso087.mp3": "Attention, Citadel Station. This is Jana Lorso, your Czerka branch's Executive Officer.",
      "203203lorso088.mp3": "As you may know, Republic negotiations with Onderon have deteriorated of late. Czerka entered Citadel Station in the hopes of resolving the situation for the good of Telos.",
      "203203lorso089.mp3": "I regret to inform you that the Telosian government, with the aid of the Ithorians, has entered an anti-Republic treaty with Onderon.",
      "203203lorso090.mp3": "In order to protect the Republic's investment in Citadel Station and for the betterment of Telos, Czerka has been forced to assume command of the station.",
      "203203lorso091.mp3": "Until Republic forces arrive to formally depose the Telosian council and restore order, Citadel Station will remain under Czerka control.",
      "203203lorso092.mp3": "This should not affect your daily affairs. Please go about your business as usual. Thank you for your cooperation.",
      "203203lorso162.mp3": "That's proof enough for me. I will dispatch CSD to take him into custody immediately.",
      "203203lorso163.mp3": "Now, for your payment. Here are the credits we agreed upon.",
      "203203lorso164.mp3": "Dissension is always a great danger in the workplace. Keeping it culled and the troublemakers out of sight makes my job much easier.",
      "203203lorso160.mp3": "Let me hear the recording first.",
      "203203lorso145.mp3": "I'll be honest with you - that one will never amount to anything. Can't see past his jealousy, lets it consume him. If he could redirect to fuel his ambition, well yes, then I'd be worried.",
      "203203lorso146.mp3": "But all the same, that sort of sentiment is dangerous. If it spread to the rest of my workers... Perhaps I should take steps to take care of this mutinous sentiment while it is still early.",
      "203203lorso158.mp3": "Glad to hear it. I've no tolerance for people who don't have the stomach for business. However, I want him dealt with quietly, officially. That's what I'll need your help for.",
      "203203lorso148.mp3": "But don't worry. If you don't have the stomach to deal with the situation in a direct, expedient manner, you can still be of some help to me.",
      "203203lorso156.mp3": "I see.",
      "203203lorso157.mp3": "You don't have to decide now. Think it over, I'll keep the offer on the table.",
      "203203lorso149.mp3": "If I'm to have Falt arrested by CSD, I still need some sort of proof that he seeks to undermine our operation.",
      "203203lorso155.mp3": "I feel that would raise too many eyebrows. While I am in favor of an expedient solution, I must put great store in discretion.",
      "203203lorso150.mp3": "That is an excellent suggestion. Get him to spill his plans to you, then bring me the evidence,",
      "203203lorso151.mp3": "I will then have him taken in by CSD, and send him along to Czerka internal investigations, and I'll have him out of my hair.",
      "203203lorso152.mp3": "I'll pay you 500 credits for bringing me evidence of Falt's plans.",
      "203203lorso154.mp3": "[Failure] I don't think Falt is the type to put you in any danger. 500 is fair.",
      "203203lorso147.mp3": "I see. In that case, I will ask you to keep your ears and eyes open for further signs. I would be interested in hearing if it came up again.",
      "203203lorso085.mp3": "Good. I'll be sure to send some of my men in to make sure they don't have the opportunity to reorganize. You've done well.",
      "203203lorso086.mp3": "Yes, of course. I will provide a shuttle for you to land on the planet's surface as per our agreement.",
      "203203lorso166.mp3": "The shuttle will be arriving shortly in Docking Bay 3, Dock Module 126. I have informed bay control that you are on your way.",
      "203203lorso167.mp3": "Again, Czerka thanks you for your help, and hopes that we may continue our working relationship in the future.",
      "203203lorso076.mp3": "You proved that you can handle yourself quite well in dealing with the retrieval of the droid intelligence.",
      "203203lorso077.mp3": "The next matter of business I would ask of you is much more delicate.",
      "203203lorso078.mp3": "When we first set up here on Citadel Station, the Exchange was already quite well established. Loppak Slusk had more influence over business matters than the Telosian government.",
      "203203lorso079.mp3": "To ensure our success, we involved ourselves with the Exchange, and now that we have a handle on the situation, we wish to un-entangle ourselves from them.",
      "203203lorso080.mp3": "If you know anything about the Exchange, then you know that they would not take this well. Slusk is loathe to have his hands removed from any business on the station, so a more direct method will have to be taken.",
      "203203lorso170.mp3": "Whatever it takes to get the Exchange out of the picture, it's the end result that concerns me.",
      "203203lorso082.mp3": "I realize it won't be an easy task, as Slusk keeps himself well protected. You would be well compensated for it.",
      "203203lorso083.mp3": "I have a feeling they won't just let you march into their offices.",
      "203203lorso084.mp3": "Luxa is Slusk's second. She spends little time in the Exchange offices, though, preferring the cantina in the Urban module. She might be able to set up an appointment.",
      "203203lorso171.mp3": "Good. I will be happy to continue our working relationship.",
      "203203lorso047.mp3": "I knew you'd come eventually. I am confident that we will be able to reach a working agreement satisfactory to both you and I.",
      "203203lorso048.mp3": "But where are my manners? On behalf of Czerka Corporation, I would like to be the first to welcome you to Telos.",
      "203203lorso131.mp3": "Truly? I hadn't heard that from any of the searchers in my employment.",
      "203203lorso129.mp3": "I am glad to hear of it. Don't worry. I'll be sure that the TSF has no way of learning of your connection to the incident.",
      "203203lorso130.mp3": "And of course, here is your payment. Czerka Corporation thanks you for your assistance.",
      "203203lorso116.mp3": "Finally. He's eluded Czerka's best agents, and I'm glad to hear of your success.",
      "203203lorso127.mp3": "A suggestion, then. Czerka has many resources at its disposal, and I do not take such insults lightly.",
      "203203lorso117.mp3": "I see. Then all that remains is to finish this business.",
      "203203lorso125.mp3": "Are you sure? I would be more than willing to compensate you for seeing this business through to the end.",
      "203203lorso126.mp3": "I have a plan that would serve my ends quite well.",
      "203203lorso123.mp3": "Yes, of course, that's what I meant. Finish this business with him. If you could bring him here, I could discuss a method of payment with him.",
      "203203lorso118.mp3": "I could certainly use your assistance, if you are offering it.",
      "203203lorso119.mp3": "You could bring Batono out of his apartment, and lead him into a trap. I will send some mercenaries to intercept you.",
      "203203lorso120.mp3": "And likely no one would suspect your involvement. Yes, that is a good plan.",
      "203203lorso122.mp3": "I see. It makes little difference, you understand. You can hardly stop the will of Czerka when it comes to a matter of this sort.",
      "203203lorso121.mp3": "Lead him into our little snare, and my men will take care of the rest.",
      "203203lorso099.mp3": "Batono? Of course, he was one of our former employees.",
      "203203lorso100.mp3": "Let me tell you something. There are far too many like him. Do-gooders who believe that because of the things Czerka must do to remain successful and profitable, we must be evil.",
      "203203lorso101.mp3": "They do not see the impracticality of their beliefs, they do not understand the realities of the galaxy. If certain funds must be paid, then Czerka will gladly pay, if competitors removed, then Czerka will do its part to forward progress.",
      "203203lorso102.mp3": "Batono could not see this. Before leaving our employ, he stole many of our records, then began to stalk our movements on the station. Harassment, but conveniently overlooked - sanctioned, perhaps - by the Telosian authorities.",
      "203203lorso113.mp3": "That's no surprise, the Lieutenant is always meddling in our business.",
      "203203lorso114.mp3": "But that doesn't change the fact that Czerka would like him out of our hair. It is, after all, a Czerka matter, involving a former Czerka employee.",
      "203203lorso115.mp3": "Thank you. As always, you continue to prove to be one of our most valuable assets. If you should locate him, you will be rewarded.",
      "203203lorso103.mp3": "I am curious, though, as to why you are looking for him.",
      "203203lorso104.mp3": "I see. Well, I suspect he's putting his nose into something or another. People like him can't mind their own business, always needing to pry into matters that don't concern them.",
      "203203lorso105.mp3": "I do know he spent some time in the company of the Ithorians. I assumed that was the reason for his efforts - that he thought by inventing stories of Czerka's evil, he could put Chodo Habat and his incapable assistants in charge.",
      "203203lorso106.mp3": "But if you are searching for him and find him, there would be a reward for any information of his whereabouts.",
      "203203lorso112.mp3": "Excellent. Czerka will be glad to be free of his baseless accusations and rumor mongering.",
      "203203lorso111.mp3": "If your conscience demands it, then by all means. Just remember, a reward is waiting for you.",
      "203203lorso109.mp3": "Silence his lies and fabricated untruths. His slanderous accusations are a needless trouble atop a great many troubles this planet faces.",
      "203203lorso110.mp3": "If credits are what he wants, then Czerka will pay him for an easy settlement of this situation. Otherwise, Czerka will be forced into a lengthy petition process with the Telosian council.",
      "203203lorso107.mp3": "I would be happy to have him out of Czerka's hair. He's been hard to track down. So yes, a reward would be offered.",
      "203203lorso108.mp3": "Two hundred credits, and the thanks of Czerka Corporation.",
      "203203lorso069.mp3": "I can understand why you might be on their side, but believe me, you wouldn't be doing Telos any favors assisting those amateurs.",
      "203203lorso070.mp3": "Oh sure, Habat's intentions are good enough, but good intentions won't restore Telos. His expensive policy of relocating biological specimens from Onderon, without any planning will doom Telos in the end.",
      "203203lorso071.mp3": "I don't think Habat even realizes that at their current pace, they will run out of funding before even half of the restoration zones are up and running.",
      "203203lorso072.mp3": "Czerka plans to use some of the planet's own resources to help fund the restoration. These extra funds will greatly improve the project in the long run. Habat, on the other hand, can't see beyond his own selfish concerns.",
      "203203lorso073.mp3": "We've discovered that the surface of Telos is covered with military facilities that were either destroyed or abandoned during the Sith attack.",
      "203203lorso074.mp3": "Salvaged raw materials from these sites can either be reprocessed and put back into service, or resold to help fund the project.",
      "203203lorso049.mp3": "Our primary concern on Citadel Station is the restoration of Telos' surface. The Republic is eager to revitalize Telos as a benchmark for other such efforts in other systems.",
      "203203lorso050.mp3": "While a generous amount of credits has been budgeted to Telos, the bumbling of Chodo Habat and his Ithorians has squandered away much of these resources.",
      "203203lorso051.mp3": "For a project of this size, judicious planning and thrifty spending of resources is a necessity, something Habat fails to understand.",
      "203203lorso052.mp3": "Nonetheless, Czerka remains optimistic. There are many jobs we need assistance with. For someone with your experience, you would be well compensated.",
      "203203lorso053.mp3": "Czerka has been managing the restoration project without the assistance of a droid for some time now. Habat has commandeered the new droid intelligence that was to be delivered to the Station.",
      "203203lorso054.mp3": "I'd like for you to meet the shipment at Dock Module 126, Shuttle Bay 2, and bring the droid back here, before the Ithorians foul things up again.",
      "203203lorso066.mp3": "While B-4D4 is perfectly capable of handling Czerka's needs when it comes to accounting and recordkeeping, he simply is not capable of dealing with the running of a project as massive as the restoration of Telos.",
      "203203lorso061.mp3": "Don't worry, Czerka wouldn't expect you to work unpaid, and won't subject you to veiled threats and coercion like Habat.",
      "203203lorso062.mp3": "For your help in this matter, you will be paid the sum of 250 credits.",
      "203203lorso065.mp3": "[Failure] Ha! With Habat, you'd be lucky if he paid you at all.",
      "203203lorso064.mp3": "[Failure] I will not ransom the future of Telos to pay for your greed. 250 credits is more than fair.",
      "203203lorso063.mp3": "[Success] You're right. 300 credits would be much more reasonable.",
      "203203lorso057.mp3": "'Requisition,' if it helps. As the Republic's fund for the restoration of Telos is now divided between both parties, it really isn't 'stealing,' as you put it.",
      "203203lorso058.mp3": "It will save the Republic time and money if we cut through the process of having a droid transferred to us. It will be better for Telos in the long run.",
      "203203lorso059.mp3": "If you're worried about the TSF, don't be. If they poke their noses into your business, I will personally take care of it.",
      "203203lorso060.mp3": "But I wouldn't worry too much. The TSF understands the importance of letting us do our work.",
      "203203lorso055.mp3": "Excellent. I will secure credits for your payment immediately.",
      "203203lorso056.mp3": "Oh, and here. You might need this to get into the hangar.",
      "203203lorso025.mp3": "Excellent, I see my faith in your abilities was well founded.",
      "203203lorso026.mp3": "We'd like to get this droid into service as quickly as possible. Opo Chano?",
      "203203lorso042.mp3": "Just plug into the mainframe and get to work.",
      "203203lorso044.mp3": "You may go, Chano, I'm sure you have many repairs to see to.",
      "203203lorso046.mp3": "Now then, your payment. Here are the credits agreed upon.",
      "203203lorso028.mp3": "Well, then, you've proven helpful enough so far. Let's see what you can do.",
      "203203lorso030.mp3": "Your opinion was not asked for, Opo Chano.",
      "203203lorso031.mp3": "I'll have no further use for you today, you may go.",
      "203203lorso034.mp3": "Just plug into the mainframe and get to work.",
      "203203lorso036.mp3": "Now then, your payment. Here are the credits agreed upon.",
      "203203lorso037.mp3": "And a small bonus for performing the repairs, as well.",
      "203203lorso096.mp3": "There is another task I would like for you to perform for me.",
      "203203lorso097.mp3": "Do you doubt that I will uphold my part of our agreement? Don't worry, when my word is given, it will not be retracted.",
      "203203lorso098.mp3": "Now, on to business.",
      "203203lorso094.mp3": "I simply do not have time for you. My hands are full with trying to manage the restoration project without the aid of a droid intelligence, which you so kindly gifted to the Ithorians.",
      "203203lorso095.mp3": "If there is nothing else, I would prefer it if you left our premises.",
      "203203lorso134.mp3": "I had my reservations about some of these mercenaries, but I had hoped that CSD would be able to keep them in line.",
      "203203lorso135.mp3": "It appears that I was wrong.",
      "203203lorso140.mp3": "Mercenaries stay here until they are transported to the surface. The restoration zones have proven to be extremely dangerous due to the deadly creatures imported by the Ithorians.",
      "203203lorso141.mp3": "As you might expect, it was credits they were after. Despite the fact Czerka has paid them more than adequately, they figured that Czerka could easily be coerced into increasing their 'fees.'",
      "203203lorso137.mp3": "Of course. I understand the importance of keeping a valuable asset like yourself happy. I believe these credits should be sufficient to repay you for your work.",
      "203203lorso138.mp3": "You are also welcome to anything found on the mercenaries' bodies as your own. They carried no Czerka-issue equipment, anyway.",
      "203203lorso139.mp3": "Now, if you will excuse me, this unfortunate turn of events has generated quite a bit more work for me, and I should be getting to it.",
      "203203lorso136.mp3": "Indeed - credits cannot buy loyalty, but greed can. And if there is one thing you can count on with people - mercenaries especially - it is their greed.",
      "203203lorso019.mp3": "Hello, B-4D4.",
      "203203lorso024.mp3": "On your way, now.",
      "203203lorso020.mp3": "Is there something you need?",
      "203203lorso021.mp3": "Oh? Why is that?",
      "203203lorso022.mp3": "More credits, you say? That's news I wouldn't mind reporting to the Sector Executive Officer.",
      "203203lorso023.mp3": "Please, B-4D4, access away.",
      "203203lorso165.mp3": "B-4D4! I want you to pull up the maintenance records on that T1 unit. Find out the last time it was given a memory wipe and how it could have been outfitted with illegal weaponry.",
      "203merclead009.mp3": "I will not be badgered by you.",
      "203merclead011.mp3": "{Somewhat surprised, by covering it well}Ah, there you are. I was wondering when you would arrive.",
      "203rodkill001.mp3": "I will arrange transport to one of the restoration zones on the planet's surface. You will be safe from the TSF there.",
      "203rodkill003.mp3": "For the services you have offered to Czerka, you will also be reimbursed. I trust that is an agreeable arrangement?",
      "203rodkill005.mp3": "Of course. I will instruct the commander to await your arrival.",
      "203rodkill022.mp3": "And? If memory serves me correctly, it wasn't too long ago that you were wanted by Grenn and his cronies.",
      "203rodkill024.mp3": "Consider the charges against them cleared, as well. They committed no crime against this station, the TSF had no reason to arrest them.",
      "203rodkill023.mp3": "Right, you only destroyed an entire mining facility.",
      "203rodkill010.mp3": "I have just finalized a working agreement with these two gentlemen, Czerka's two newest contract employees.",
      "203rodkill011.mp3": "Be reasonable. I have given them a contract and my word that they will be safe from TSF persecution.",
      "203rodkill012.mp3": "Gentlemen, would you excuse us?",
      "203rodkill015.mp3": "They will take the next shuttle to the restoration zones and be out of the reach of Grenn. This does not affect you.",
      "203rodkill017.mp3": "I think you forget that I have already agreed to smuggle you to the restoration zones to find your lost ship.",
      "203rodkill018.mp3": "You are wanted by the Republic. That's no small task I have agreed to.",
      "203rodkill019.mp3": "So you will excuse me if I suggest that you turn a blind eye to this occasion, and be grateful that I do not rescind our agreement.",
      "203rodkill021.mp3": "By all means, if that will make you happy. But if they get the best of you, it will be of no moment to me.",
      "203rodkill020.mp3": "I suggest that you do, lest I forget about our agreement. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must see to some things so that Czerka may continue to be in the good graces of the Council.",
      "203rodkill016.mp3": "You will not undo work the work that I have done here. I do not break my word, and will not start here.",
      "503sakarie027.mp3": "Are you satisfied with your payment for the visa? I can exchange it for something else if you like.",
      "503sakarie033.mp3": "Aren't we all? But there's nothing I can do to help with that. My backside is still scorched from the heat I've got recently. Ask around elsewhere.",
      "503sakarie032.mp3": "The visa wasn't for me, but for an associate of mine. There are plenty of business opportunities left in Iziz. I plan to stay here for awhile.",
      "503sakarie028.mp3": "You aren't? Then what would you like instead?",
      "503sakarie031.mp3": "Done.",
      "503sakarie030.mp3": "Done.",
      "503sakarie029.mp3": "Done.",
      "503sakarie001.mp3": "There's got to be something you need. Something you want. I have connections, many connections in the city. I can provide high-quality unique weapons that you won't be able to find elsewhere.",
      "503sakarie024.mp3": "Because we'll trade them simultaneously. And if you aren't satisfied with your payment, I'll let you switch it for something else. I don't want to cross a Jedi.",
      "503sakarie025.mp3": "It's a small universe. I don't really care about the trouble that's behind you or ahead of you. We have exactly one thing we can talk about - starport visas.",
      "503sakarie018.mp3": "Many Jedi have fought on this world. One of them lost their lightsaber in the Beast Wars. A reliable source says it's a rare Qixoni crystal. Incredibly rare and valuable.",
      "503sakarie023.mp3": "I see that's grabbed your interest, eh? There's only one way you're going to get it - one open starport visa. No visa, no crystal.",
      "503sakarie015.mp3": "Don't worry what I'll do with the visa. Maybe I'll just take a vacation. Maybe I just want to visit my mother on Nar Shaddaa. Decent citizens like you really don't want to know what I'm going to do with it.",
      "503sakarie017.mp3": "I am not going to tell you what I'm using it for. Considering what I'm willing to pay or give you - no questions asked seems reasonable.",
      "503sakarie016.mp3": "You have an honest face... I will answer your question... I need to transport permacrete explosives for the Exchange. They're going to use it to take care of some competition and some local authorities. Permanently.",
      "503sakarie006.mp3": "I had faith you'd get a hold of one. I've always been good at spotting talent. I've got big plans for it.",
      "503sakarie014.mp3": "You won't find a better deal anywhere on Iziz for the visa. You'd be a sap to give it to anyone else.",
      "503sakarie010.mp3": "So what do you want for it? A weapon, money, or the lightsaber crystal. Your pick.",
      "503sakarie013.mp3": "Here you go. If you aren't satisfied with it, just let me know.",

      "602berun054.mp3": "I've heard that rumor, too. People get really riled up about Jedi around here. Some people seem to have a selective memory.",
      "602berun055.mp3": "During the war, the Jedi were a big help here. They did everything for us, from clearing out dangerous beasts to solving a murder investigation.",
      "602berun056.mp3": "I try to stay out of it, though. Standing up for Jedi is one way to become unpopular around here.",
      "602berun063.mp3": "Eh. I've heard all that before. I don't agree with you. But there are plenty of people who would.",
      "602berun058.mp3": "Heh. Easy to say for someone that doesn't live here. I'd rather grab an unshielded power coupling than get involved in that debate. The militia is dealing with enough already.",
      "602berun053.mp3": "{He's not pleased that he's not on the loop on this one}I don't know what Saedhe{SAY-d} is up to. He's working directly with Zherron on that investigation. Sorry I can't help.",
      "602berun052.mp3": "If you want to know more, ask Daraala. She's the smart one in the salvager camp.",
      "602berun051.mp3": "Oh, you heard about that? We have so much to look into that Suulru's concern is pretty low on our list. We asked the salvagers, but they claim that the salvager responsible is nowhere to be found.",
      "602berun050.mp3": "You should see Administrator Adare about that. She'll be able to set you up. You're not a typical salvager, so I don't expect you'll have any trouble there.",
      "602berun045.mp3": "{His friendliness is a little more uncertain now - he gives the PC the benefit of the doubt and assumes he's joking}I see... Well, I suppose it wouldn't hurt to go over the militia rules then. Khoonda{COON-da} and the salvager camp are under militia protection.",
      "602berun046.mp3": "So a friendly scuffle is all right, but if any blasters are drawn there will be hell to pay. But if you buy some Jedi trinket and you're not satisfied, you're on your own.",
      "602berun047.mp3": "{He sounds disapproving of the difficulties, but unlike most people it isn't scorn directed at them. He's upset that the militia has made matters worse}I'd stay away from the mercenary camp. We've had... difficulties with them. We don't patrol or investigate there any more. A trip there, and you're on your own.",
      "602berun048.mp3": "Follow the rules and we don't have any problems. Oh - and Pato Ado{pa-TOE ah-DOE} doesn't cheat as far as we can figure. So don't complain about the Ithorian, either.",
      "602berun043.mp3": "I don't even want to get into it. Ask around if you want to know the details. It'll just make my headache worse if I talk about it.",
      "602berun044.mp3": "I don't know what we'd do without Administrator Adare. She managed to plow through a lot of the family bickering once the Sith left during the war. She's kept us together. Oh, and uh, Zherron, too, I suppose.",
      "602berun041.mp3": "{He sounds proud of his position - but there is a hint of trouble}Well call me a defective protocol droid. Manners, right? I'm Berun Modrul, I'm Captain Zherron's{zeh-ron} right hand man. I help run the militia here.",
      "602berun042.mp3": "Well, that makes it sound more important than I am. Zherron takes a hands-on role in running the militia. If you have any real trouble, you'd have to go to him anyway.",
      "602berun013.mp3": "You haven't? Well, that's something. I'm the second in command over here, and we keep getting \"incidents.\" Our staff is stretched thin. Too thin.",
      "602berun014.mp3": "{His tone should change here - much more neutral, he doesn't approve of Zherron but is trying to be diplomatic about it}If you do have trouble, I'm not the one to talk to. You'd need to talk to Zherron{zeh-ron}. He takes a hands-on role as the militia captain.",
      "602berun016.mp3": "{When he talks about what \"people\" believe, it should be clear he believes it, too}The thing is, he expects everyone to follow all the laws. That's not normally a bad thing. But the mercenaries are used to having a bit more freedom.",
      "602berun017.mp3": "So it's like Zherron keeps prodding a rancor with a stun stick. To a rancor it's just a minor nuisance, but if you keep at it he's going to fight back.",
      "602berun018.mp3": "The mercenaries aren't unreasonable. They're mostly just war veterans looking for work. But Zherron just keeps poking them.",
      "602berun019.mp3": "So he has to get involved to make sure that the militia does what he wants. Otherwise, we'd probably give the mercenaries some room.",
      "602berun040.mp3": "{He doesn't take this badly}No, it really isn't. It's one of the many Dantooine problems grown right here at home. If we could export them, we'd be rich.",
      "602berun029.mp3": "{He doesn't sound convinced by this argument}Dantooine has had mercenaries on it for years. I've talked with some, and they're not unreasonable. There's got to be some sort of compromise we can both live with.",
      "602berun038.mp3": "Yeah, you're probably right. There's no obvious solution to this.",
      "602berun035.mp3": " There's danger everywhere. I think the direction we're headed may be even more dangerous. I can see we don't agree on this.",
      "602berun030.mp3": "Heh. Using my own analogy against me? The mercenaries aren't rancors. They're people like you and me. But if you keep provoking them...",
      "602berun021.mp3": "I also think he's doing more to provoke them than just investigating every complaint against them hard. He's up to something.",
      "602berun022.mp3": "If someone could just ask a few questions, turn up some answers, maybe see if Zherron isn't being completely honest with the rest of us? Well, then maybe he should be replaced.",
      "602berun028.mp3": "{He doesn't seem to be put out by the request for money}Definitely, the militia makes sure to reward anybody that helps out Dantooine. And if he's doing something risky...",
      "602berun026.mp3": "So if you happen to find something out like that, you should see Administrator Adare. If you have to do some footwork to check into things, you'll be compensated.",
      "602berun024.mp3": "Just a lot of little things don't add up. It could just be a surprise party. But I think Zherron takes this problem very personal.",
      "602berun011.mp3": "Let me guess, you were tricked out of some credits. Sorry, friend, but we don't do anything about that anymore. Don't you know our rules?",
      "602berun012.mp3": "Glad you asked. So here are the militia rules then. Khoonda{COON-da} and the salvager camp are under militia protection.",
      "602berun067.mp3": "Oh, sorry. If you're brand new to these parts, you may not have any issues with Gerevick, unlike most everyone else.",
      "602berun006.mp3": "{He's not so subtly giving the PC the green light to cause trouble with Gerevick - but is he joking, is he serious, hard to say}I didn't hear that. And I'll continue not to hear that if anything does happen to Gerevick. We think he may have murdered a couple of folks.",
      "602berun007.mp3": "But he's not some feral Wookiee. He's got brains. We can't prove anything. But if he isn't your problem, who is causing you trouble?",
      "602berun068.mp3": "{uncomfortable}Um, is there anything else I can help you with?",
      "602berun005.mp3": "Most people follow the rules and just try to get by in life. He's a salvager. His purpose in life seems to be causing us headaches.",
      "602berun004.mp3": "Well, that's good news. I keep expecting someone to come barging in saying Gerevick threatened them or something. He causes endless headaches.",
      "602berun002.mp3": "{He's exaggerating slightly for effect and in a chummy sort of way - I want the PC to like this guy}You're fortunate not to know him. He's a salvager. His purpose in life seems to be causing us headaches.",
      "602berun003.mp3": "I can tell he's back in Khoonda just by the pounding in my head. If you're not here about Gerevick{GUERRE-eh-vick}, do you have some other problem?",
      "602berun069.mp3": "It was an honor to fight by your side, Jedi.",
      "602berun071.mp3": "Zherron was right about the mercenaries all along. I guess my ego clouded my judgement as to what's best for Khoonda.",
      "602terena086.mp3": "{Kissing ass}I'm grateful for your support, Administrator. As the new leader of the militia I swear to support your goals of peace and compromise."

      "207207luxa032.mp3": "Strange. I would not expect he'd be able to escape the Station without our knowledge. I'll have to look into it to see that this does not happen again.",
      "207207luxa114.mp3": "I see. Well, at the very least, we should be able to sell his equipment and possessions and regain our losses that way.",
      "207207luxa113.mp3": "And I'm sure he learned it very well in the moments before his life ended.",
      "207207luxa112.mp3": "True. He likely had a good supply of equipment and droid parts that he was to repair or use for repairs. We could sell them off and possibly recoup more than the 2,500 credits owed to us.",
      "207207luxa025.mp3": "Already? It's a pleasant change to have someone who so diligently and successfully completes the tasks set before them. But then, I was fairly sure you were the capable sort.",
      "207207luxa026.mp3": "Before you say anything - yes, I will arrange the meeting with Slusk that you desired.",
      "207207luxa027.mp3": "But first, I was wondering if you might listen to a proposition. A business proposition, given your obvious abilities.",
      "207207luxa107.mp3": "Let me ask you an honest question - this meeting with Slusk you want, it's because Lorso's fed up with him, right?",
      "207207luxa108.mp3": "I feel the same way about Slusk, and I think it's time someone solved the problem. I think that maybe our interests lie in the same direction.",
      "207207luxa109.mp3": "Now I know you're not dull enough that you can't read through the lines. Slusk's no good for anybody's business - yours, Lorso's or mine.",
      "207207luxa110.mp3": "But there's a problem, Slusk's boss, Goto. Now this Goto... he's rigid, ruthlessly efficient - and all he sees are numbers.",
      "207207luxa002.mp3": "'Almost.' I had enough faith in you to know that you could handle any on-the-job dangers that popped up.",
      "207207luxa021.mp3": "Unfortunate. But they paid the price for trying to take advantage of the Exchange.",
      "207207luxa004.mp3": "At least the deal is done and paid for.",
      "207207luxa006.mp3": "I've got some more work for you, if you're up for it. A matter of a rather sizeable debt owed to the Exchange.",
      "207207luxa020.mp3": "And you will. I just need you to perform this one last service for me.",
      "207207luxa104.mp3": "I trust you - why else would I request your help with Exchange business?",
      "207207luxa105.mp3": "Precisely.",

      "207207luxa009.mp3": "We've been patient with him, but we can only let a debt go unpaid for so long.",
      "207207luxa013.mp3": "Hey, that's the business. I can't be responsible for your lack of control.",
      "207207luxa015.mp3": "You'll find Chano in Unit B2, Residential 082. Tell him his time is up, and we want those credits.",
      "207207luxa016.mp3": "Then rough him up - put some fear into him. Make sure he understands the situation.",
      "207207luxa019.mp3": "Look, if I wanted you dead, I think I'd send some armed killers.",
      "207207luxa103.mp3": "And Chano's harmless. He's just a technician. I wouldn't worry yourself.",
      "207207luxa017.mp3": "Look, I don't care how you get the credits out of him. Just take care of it.",
      "207207luxa018.mp3": "Good. I knew I could count on you.",
      "207benok013.mp3": "Oh, leave the woman alone, Benok. I bet she'd come out on top if you fought.",

      "207benok008.mp3": "It's your skin, Benok. Just warning you - Slusk could easily replace you.",
      "203203luxa001.mp3": "Well, that's all wrapped up. I've got to thank you for your help.",

      "512dhagon021.mp3": "We go way back. Way before he became Mandalore. In my experience Mandalorians always know about the doctors around. For some strange reason they keep getting into scrapes. If you want to know more, ask him yourself.",

      "512dhagon019.mp3": "Patients, customers, idiotic Hutt spawn... call them what you like. Most doctors tell you that they got into the business to save lives. Most of them are flaming liars. At least I'll tell you the truth, I'm in it for the credits.",
      "512dhagon007.mp3": "Not many people can help you out with that. There've been several assassination attempts on Queen Talia. That place is locked tighter than a Hutt's vault. I know a few people though. Who do you need to get in touch with?",
      "512dhagon008.mp3": "A Jedi Master, you say? Now that is interesting. There's quite a bounty on Jedi these days. Not that I'm looking to collect, but if there's a Master there... I think I know who it is.",
      "512dhagon014.mp3": "I'm not certain, otherwise I'd tell you. But the man I'm thinking about is smart, likes to stay in the shadows, and is cryptic as hell. If he isn't a Jedi Master, he should become one.",
      "512dhagon010.mp3": "The thing is scavengers have already looted most of my stuff. Most of it's garbage anyway, so I don't care too much. But I did have a couple of encrypted holodiscs that they nabbed.",
      "512dhagon011.mp3": "So! Here's the punch line. I need those discs because they have some contact information on them. The people I know you don't just walk up to and chat with. There's a procedure. And that holodisc has the procedure.",
      "512dhagon012.mp3": "Bakkel's gang pretty much owns this street. From what I hear she's the one that cleaned me out. ",
      "512dhagon041.mp3": "She's in the local cantina most days. She's tough as drexl leather and more dangerous than an angry Wookiee. If you take Mandalore with you, though, you should be just fine.",
      "512dhagon013.mp3": "Just get me the encrypted holodisc. After that, if there is a Jedi Master in the Palace, I'll get you a meeting with him.",
      "512dhagon004.mp3": "Wrong place, wrong time. Captain Sullio and I were acquaintances. I just happened to be too close when she got dead. A real shame. She wasn't bad to look at, and she could drink.",
      "512dhagon001.mp3": "So you still intend to go through with it? I can schedule the meeting with your Jedi Master as soon as you like.",

      "602suulru026.mp3": "Before the Mandalorian Wars we were making great gains in civilizing this world. The kinrath and kath hounds were mainly under control. We were small but prosperous.",

      "602suulru034.mp3": "That could mean disaster for all of us.",
      "602suulru023.mp3": "Yes, I fought in the Jedi Civil War. I guess we 'won'. You couldn't tell here, though. It feels like we've been forsaken by the Republic.",
      "602suulru024.mp3": "{Very somber tone}The war was very unkind to Dantooine. That hidden Enclave cost us a great deal. A great deal.",
      "602suulru080.mp3": "Well, yes and no. I brought my moisture vaporator to Khoonda to be serviced. On the way back to my farm, I took a shortcut next to the Enclave ruins.",
      "602suulru082.mp3": "I went to their camp to get back my moisture vaporator. This smug fellow, Jorran, told me that he found it within the ruins, and by law it belongs to him now."

      "602suulru085.mp3": "I understand that the wheels turn slowly on this sort of thing, but my crops are in immediate danger. The salvaging laws on Dantooine are a mess, and in my mind they favor the salvagers.",

      "602suulru083.mp3": "He said he'd give it to me for the \"bargain\" price of 500 credits! I wasn't very happy about it, but the law was on his side. So I paid the scoundrel.",
      "602suulru084.mp3": "Now the moisture vaporator doesn't work because it is mysteriously missing its modulator. Jorran is offering to sell me a modulator he 'found' for another 500 credits.",

      "602zherron011.mp3": "That's fine. Better take care of anything you need to first.",

      "602zherron005.mp3": "I don't know for certain. It could be a day, or even a week. Depends on how good Azkul{AZ-CULL} is at organizing his men. I'm guessing not so good.",
      "602zherron003.mp3": "We could use people handy with a blaster. Getting people to join the militia for a short stint would be good.",

      "503tobin039.mp3": "{Incredulity}Then why did you help Anda? You would serve Talia, instead? We could help you settle your score with Kavar.",

      "503tobin027.mp3": "There is no way they could possibly stand up to you, but they don't know that. Leave Iziz and don't come back until we send a message for you.",
      "503tobin015.mp3": "If the payment I've offered you is insufficient, I assure you General Vaklu himself can offer you a satisfactory deal.",
      "503tobin024.mp3": "We would send you a message. To your Mandalorian allies on the Dxun moon. We still need the Sith Lord to take care of a few things first.",

      "506tobin008.mp3": "The plan seems to be working. The Sith and their forces went to the north. But the beasts turned on the Sith, and us. It is chaos behind me.",
      "506tobin009.mp3": "In order to get to the throne room we'll have to open the outer and inner security doors. There are security terminals to the north and south.",

      "506tobin012.mp3": "Then we deal with Talia and her hand-picked soldiers. And you'll have to face Master Kavar.",

      "602terena056.mp3": "Dantooine is one of the younger worlds of the Republic. A couple of generations ago this world was still untamed. We made great progress, in no small part due to the Jedi.",
      "602terena057.mp3": "But recently we have been losing ground. During the war the most prominent settler families either fled or were executed by the Sith. Losing their resources and the Jedi was too great a loss.",

Once we achieve that, I am confident that Dantooine can be safe and prosperous again.",
      "602terena059.mp3": "{Pause and then confiding tone}No, I suppose I'm not. We need the Republic, and always have. We aren't self-sufficient yet and we need aid. The fate of the Telos project is intimately tied to our own.",
      "602terena060.mp3": "The most humanitarian elements of the Senate have put their careers at stake in the rebuilding of Telos. If those efforts succeed, their prominence will grow and further aid will be given freely.",
      "602terena061.mp3": "But if they fail... There are colder, more authoritative elements in the Senate that could come to power. They would think nothing of leaving the strategically unimportant worlds to their own devices.",
      "602terena062.mp3": "That would be a tragic day for Dantooine and many other worlds. The Republic is in flux, its final shape is uncertain.",
      "602terena050.mp3": "To most people in the galaxy, the distinction between Sith and Jedi is a blurry one. Especially since most Sith were once Jedi.",
      "602terena051.mp3": "It is complicated by the fact that Malak and Revan were great heroes of the Republic and famed Jedi Knights. But a few years later they were leading an armada which threatened everyone.",
      "602terena052.mp3": "And here on Dantooine the Jedi Enclave provoked a brutal occupation by the Sith. It could've been far worse, but even now the damage has not been fully mended.",
      "602terena053.mp3": "I don't think everyone hates Jedi. If just a few people changed their minds or spoke up... it could make a great deal of difference. I think that we need the help of the Jedi.",
      "602terena054.mp3": "If the Jedi's reputation isn't redeemed, the consequences could be quite regrettable. Until then I would keep your identity secret.",
      "602terena048.mp3": "There are plenty of opportunities to assist people on Dantooine. Too many, I'm afraid. I would go to the militia headquarters and make your intentions known there.",
      "602terena049.mp3": "Besides that, just listen and ask around.",

      "602terena077.mp3": "{Resigned. She really doesn't want to do this}Very well. I will deal with this situation as I must.",
      "602terena078.mp3": "Guard, please bring Zherron and Berun here immediately.",
      "602terena080.mp3": "I'll get straight to the point. I have found evidence that you are unbalancing our precarious relations with the mercenaries. Do you deny this?",
      "602terena082.mp3": "I have no choice but to err on the side of diplomacy.",
      "602terena083.mp3": "Until further notice, I am giving command of the militia to Berun. {sad, hopeful}I... I hope, Zherron, that you will continue to serve as Berun's second in command.",
      "602terena085.mp3": "{Relieved}Thank you, Zherron. You are dismissed.",
      "602terena087.mp3": "{Weary}That will be all, Berun.",
      "602terena046.mp3": "I have no doubt that Berun means well, but I have every confidence in Zherron. I would ask you to ignore anything Berun asked of you. He doesn't see the full scope.",
      "602terena047.mp3": "I realize that I am asking you for help, but you must also know that I am the head of this nominal government. It wouldn't be appropriate for me to divulge all information to you.",
      "602terena042.mp3": "He was investigating the mercenaries for us. We've been increasingly concerned about them. Their behavior has always been antagonistic, but recently they've been behaving differently.",
      "602terena043.mp3": "Vrook was investigating this when he disappeared. We were counting on any hard intelligence he could provide. Our other assets have been.. unavailable recently.",
      "602terena044.mp3": "{She does say please - but her tone isn't a request}If you find any information on the mercenaries during your stay on our planet, please report it to Zherron{zeh-ron} or myself.",
      "602terena045.mp3": "I believe I've told you everything I can. Please find, and rescue Vrook.",
      "602terena015.mp3": "A visitor. Please come in. Welcome to Khoonda. I am Administrator Terena Adare. You're the owner of the, um... ship that just landed?",
      "602terena018.mp3": "I'll take it as a given that the vessel is indeed yours.",
      "602terena019.mp3": "And unless I'm much mistaken that's the Ebon Hawk. That vessel has been on Dantooine before, during the war. That was a Jedi vessel.",
      "602terena022.mp3": "My point is that the previous owner of that ship was a very... influential Jedi. And Jedi are not as admired here as they once were.",
      "602terena023.mp3": "Right or wrong, our settlers blame the Jedi and their hidden Enclave for their suffering. I remember the old Jedi Masters and the considerable help they lent to Dantooine.",
      "602terena024.mp3": "I still maintain... discreet... connections with Jedi. I suppose your arrival here is no coincidence.",
      "602terena025.mp3": "Indeed, true coincidence seems very rare in the affairs of Jedi. But I should tell you...",
      "602terena026.mp3": "My friend... Let's just call him Vrook. We've known each other for many years. And our continued friendship could create many problems in the current political climate.",
      "602terena027.mp3": "He came to Dantooine not too long ago. He was looking into something quite important. He's gone missing recently. Did he send for you in case something went wrong?",
      "602terena032.mp3": "Vrook and I had a mutually beneficial arrangement for several weeks. He went to the Jedi Enclave's sublevel recently and hasn't returned. I know the sublevel is dangerous.",
      "602terena033.mp3": "I'm starting to fear the worst. Would you be willing to go to the ruins of the Enclave to look for him?",
      "602terena036.mp3": "From what I know of your 'type,' you have all of the equipment you need to deal with the sublevel. I do realize the Jedi Order disbanded so you must find credits yourself, however.",
      "602terena037.mp3": "The sublevel is dangerous enough that the salvagers have not managed to properly search it. There are many artifacts of value. Normally I ask for a percentage of all salvage.",
      "602terena038.mp3": "In your case, however, you can take whatever you find without the customary tithe.",
      "602terena039.mp3": "I will have one of the militia transmit permissions to the Enclave's security door. Go expecting danger, for you will most certainly find it there.",
      "602terena035.mp3": "This could work to both of our advantage. You can search for artifacts for your... own interest and also for Vrook at the same time.",
      "602terena034.mp3": "{She appreciates this attitude}We are fortunate that you've come. Don't expect it to be easy, though. Things rarely are with Jedi.",
      "602terena030.mp3": "[Failure] Many mistakingly believe that Jedi are paragons of honesty. I've dealt with far too many to be fooled by this reputation. You want answers I'm not comfortable giving right now.",
      "602terena031.mp3": "But in time, with trust, we may be able to communicate more freely. I do need your help.",
      "602terena028.mp3": "[Success] {She sounds as though she is relieved, she wants to believe this lie}We need the skills of a Jedi more than ever. He was helping investigate Azkul{AZ-CULL} and his mercenaries.",
      "602terena029.mp3": "But he had his own errand to run in the Enclave. Jedi business of some sort. He went into the sublevel, which isn't without its dangers. And he hasn't returned.",
      "602terena099.mp3": "Like many parts of Dantooine, the sublevel of the Enclave has become infested with dangerous creatures. Large, vicious insects called laigreks have made the sublevel their home.",
      "602terena100.mp3": "Several salvagers have reportedly been injured or killed by the laigreks. I would expect a Jedi to fare better against the creatures than the salvagers.  But Vrook has not returned in some time.",
      "602terena074.mp3": "{Sighs}I feel I must step carefully here. You are not like other Jedi I have known. You seem darker somehow.",
      "602terena075.mp3": "Yes, I understand. Say no more. For good or ill, I feel you are the only one remaining who can help me with the present situation.",
      "602terena021.mp3": "Of course not, I'm trying to stabilize an entire planet. An Exchange bounty, no matter how abundant, is little use in that endeavor. {She doesn't want to come out and say the player is a Jedi - kind of political deniability}But if a Jedi were here, that would best be kept secret.",
      "602terena020.mp3": "That is an unfortunate truth. And a wise request, which of course I will honor. Most settlers here hold bitter memories of the Sith occupation.",
      "602terena017.mp3": "I meant no disrespect at all. It is in fact a remarkable vessel.",
      "602terena016.mp3": "{She's a tough broad and expects an answer to her question}Depending on you business here, the pleasure may be mutual. But you didn't answer my question. Is that ship yours?",
      "602terena014.mp3": "Do you require anything else, Jedi?",
      "602terena001.mp3": "I see you have found the elusive Master Vrook. He's told me that his \"rescue\" complicated our situation to some degree. {Her tone sounds disapproving of Vrook - because this criticism could also be laid against her, too. She's on the PC's side.}I can't say that I anticipated that.",
      "602terena002.mp3": "I thank you for finding him, though. Vrook has informed me that the mercenaries devised a plan of attack to annihilate Khoonda itself. I must ask for your aid again, Jedi.",
      "602terena003.mp3": "Zherron says that even with a plan, the mercenaries have to gather their forces then coordinate their assault. So we still have time. I'm afraid the militia has not been adequately trained for the task that befalls them.",
      "602terena012.mp3": "Here is a master card key that will open all of the security doors inside Khoonda. Anything that might aid you in your task, please use.",
      "602terena013.mp3": "Soon all the civilians will be evacuated. So if you have any business with them, I suggest you take care of it. Whenever you are ready to finalize the defenses, talk with Zherron{zeh-ron}.",
      "602terena011.mp3": "I have instructed the militia and other Khoonda personnel that you are to be provided with anything that can be spared. Unfortunately, that isn't much.",
      "602terena008.mp3": "Our militia is effective at peace-keeping but isn't prepared for a full-scale battle. If you can do anything to ready them for the reality of it, that would be helpful.",
      "602terena009.mp3": "Besides that, look around Khoonda and see what you can do to strengthen our defenses. I know that we don't have the perimeter turrets online, and that alone could make a significant difference.",
      "602terena010.mp3": "Zherron{zeh-ron} says there is a considerable chance they will breach Khoonda itself. Anything you can do to slow them down could turn the tide of battle.",
      "602terena006.mp3": "Right now just us and the militia. I don't want to create a needless panic. But be assured I will make sure that all civilians are warned in time so they can get to safety.",
      "602terena007.mp3": "Though if we lose this battle, nowhere on Dantooine will be safe for settlers for long.",
      "602terena004.mp3": "Certainly not. The common mercenaries are wild and undisciplined, like feral kath hounds. We didn't anticipate that their leadership could organize anything so elaborate.",
      "602terena005.mp3": "We were wrong. But thanks to you and Master Vrook we now have a chance to win this battle.",
      "602terena098.mp3": "I've placed Zherron back in charge of Khoonda's defense. Right or wrong, Zherron is the best man to lead the militia in this crisis.",
      "602terena090.mp3": "{overjoyed and relieved}Thank you so much for your aid. You can be sure that Dantooine will not forget how the Jedi protected us from this threat.",
      "602terena092.mp3": "We are a humble community, and this conflict has greatly diminished our resources. I hope this reward will be sufficient.",
      "602terena097.mp3": "{confused}Um, okay... Certainly. I will commission a great statue of your likeness.",
      "602terena096.mp3": "{She is touched by your generosity}I am humbled by your generosity. I will put this to good use.",
      "602terena095.mp3": "{uncomfortable and a little disappointed}That is true I suppose. I can offer a little more.",
      "602terena093.mp3": "Thank you again, brave Jedi.",
      "602terena094.mp3": "Now if you'll excuse me, I have much work to do. Dantooine will be slow to rebuild, but I am confident now that we will one day achieve prosperity.",
      "602terena091.mp3": "I'm sorry to offend you. You are, of course, our savior and I am very grateful to you.",

      "605daraala021.mp3": "If you're not going to listen to anybody, maybe you can help me out. The only place that has anything is the sublevel. And only a couple of fools have gone there.",
      "605daraala022.mp3": "And they're now dead fools. Yeah, I'd like to do the decent thing and get their bodies and put them to rest. That hole isn't a fit place for a salvager.",
      "605daraala023.mp3": "So if you find a couple human corpses down there just grab their gear and their bodies. I'll pay you 500 credits for each of them.",

      "605daraala013.mp3": "Because anything valuable in the ruins was carted away months ago. The only salvagers left are either desperate, ornery, or not right in the head.",

      "605daraala015.mp3": "The only thing left is the sublevel. And that's crawling with laigreks{LAY-grex}. And those things are smarter than half the salvagers here. Though that don't take much.",
      "605daraala016.mp3": "And don't be asking any pesky questions. You're new and no one is going to help you out.",
      "605daraala017.mp3": "Because there isn't enough salvage to share with the people already here. And a hungry newcomer is about as welcome as a diarrhetic Hutt.",

      "605jorran046.mp3": "But after I sold the farmer back his moisture vaporator, I won the modulator from Daraala in a game of stones.",
      "605jorran005.mp3": "I still have those Jedi artifacts I found for you. If you don't want them I can sell them to Daraala{duh-raa-laa}.",

      "610jorran036.mp3": "I don't have any more credits on me. That's, that's really all I have.",

      "605nallek020.mp3": "I don't feel so well. I feel dizzy. I gotta go now.",
      "605nallek019.mp3": "We're preparing to attack soon. So they have to be in this sector of the galaxy. They're being very quiet about who the enemy is.",
      "605nallek018.mp3": "I told you what I know. Someone rich and powerful. We're not going to have to hit up settlers for food and supplies any more.",
      "605nallek014.mp3": "All the time. They tell us to be careful. Just scare them and make sure we get anything we want. Except Khoonda{COON-dah} we got everything under control.",
      "605nallek015.mp3": "There's been a couple of people we had to get rid of. {He sounds sad}But I wasn't on those trips. Azkul's{AZ-CULL} got it all figured out.",
      "605nallek013.mp3": "You either one of those useless salvagers or uppity settlers. {On enough it sounds like he wants to bash in a few skulls}I've had *enough* of your type.",
      "605nallek004.mp3": "[Success] You fight in any wars? I fought in the Jedi Civil War. I guess you don't look like much of a salvager.",
      "605nallek010.mp3": "{He doesn't sound threatening - he views this as a fair exchange}Stay out of our way and we'll stay out of yours. That's the best deal you're going to get here.",
      "605nallek008.mp3": "You were a soldier, too. You know I'm not going to answer you.",
      "605nallek009.mp3": "I-I want to answer your question. {Sounds like he has a mild headache}My head...",
      "605nallek006.mp3": "I thought you were one of those useless salvagers. Or perhaps an uppity settler. I've had about enough of their attitude.",
      "605nallek007.mp3": "So I figured blasting one of them would do me some good. Been awhile since we had work.",
      "605nallek005.mp3": "Sides don't matter much, we're all soldiers. Most of us mercenaries worked with the Sith. Not too many Republic soldiers survived the war."

      "711malak017.mp3": "A good reason. Delay would have brought ruin, and there was much suffering. You had to act.",
      "711malak018.mp3": "It was within our power to end the war. And the Council chose to debate behind closed doors while planets burned.",
      "711malak022.mp3": "Their vaunted wisdom bred only inaction. And that would've led to destruction greater than anything born of the dark side.",
      "711malak023.mp3": "So if you could do it all again... the real question is would you? The Mandalorians await on the edge of space eager to crush the Republic. You know how this turns out.",
      "711malak024.mp3": "Would you do it any different? Knowing what it costs you, knowing what it costs the rest.",

      "711malak028.mp3": "And now you are all alone. Would you join me now? You didn't follow Revan and I down our path. Join us. Your journey hasn't ended yet.",

      "711malak021.mp3": "You have learned much. You no longer need to obey their hollow teachings.",
